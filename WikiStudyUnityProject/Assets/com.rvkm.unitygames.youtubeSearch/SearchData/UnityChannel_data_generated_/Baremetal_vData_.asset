      Nope! This jam is for people who are new to Unity. (Although we do sneak some

      to install Unity?\nA: https://unity3d.com/unity/system-requirements\n\nQ: What
      is a game jam?\nA: This game jam is unique because it\u2019s hosted online,
      it\u2019s for beginners, we\u2019re using a game template, it\u2019s short,
      and we (pretty much) know what we\u2019re going to show you. A *traditional*
      game jam is an in-person event where you would typically gather with more experienced
      programmers, game designers, artists, etc., to create a game or project from
      scratch in about 24-72 hours.\n\nQ: What if I have a question that's not answered
      here?\nA: If you have other questions, reach out to us in the Karting Creators
      Group: http://ole.unity.com/Karting-Creators\n\nQ: Who hosted the jam?\nA:

      parts of version 1 of our controllers, which have been on the Asset Store for
      many years and have resulted in a solid code base. A no compromises approach
      was taken during development when determining how to implement a feature: opting
      to have an extremely polished asset instead of quickly rushing a particular
      feature out the door. \n\nA wide variety of shootable weapons such as a rocket
      launcher, sniper, and bow & arrow are included. The spring system is the heart
      of first person perspective adding bobs, shakes, and sways to the camera/items.
      The editor scripts allow you to create your character and items in seconds.
      The ability system comes with over 20 abilities or add your own functionality
      without having to change any of the included scripts. Up may not always be
      up with the adjustable dynamic gravity system. Full body awareness is supported.
      UFPS comes with more than 200 pages of documentation plus tutorial videos to
      help you easily get started on your project."

      game. We will create the core game loop - timer, score, win and lose states.
      We will also show code architecture best practices - keeping data and logic
      separate, and how to structure a game in a way that makes it easy to maintain
      and extend. We will look at some of the ways we can extend this in session

      text into other languages. We will create a LocalizationManager class that
      loads a file with localized text, and a component that can be attached to a
      text field in order to populate it with the localized text at runtime.  We
      will also look at loading and parsing JSON files, dictionaries and some data
      driven best practices.'

      Merry
      Fragmas everyone! Mike Geig returns with a festive live training session packed
      with wanton yuletide destruction! In this session we will be building a Networked
      Multiplayer First Person Shooter game. The content will range from beginner
      to intermediate as we look at scripting and features specific to multiplayer
      networking. As this is an updated version of the Merry Fragmas live training
      from last December, some concepts will move more quickly. Another notable change
      is that this year we will be using the new networking system built into Unity
      instead of Photon. Pack a lunch because we are going to complete this in a
      single session even if it means we go over our usual 1 hour limit. Let the
      slay bells ring!

      In
      this live training session we will create a flexible player ability system
      which includes player abilities with cool downs, similar to those seen in MOBA
      or MMO games. The approach uses scriptable objects and is designed to allow
      game designers to create multiple variations of an ability and swap between
      them easily.

      to 4:07 to bypass intro and technical issues.

      Do you want to know how
      to keep your data between scenes? How about between executions of your game?
      During this session we will learn how to do both. We will look at things like
      DontDestroyOnLoad, PlayerPrefs, and data serialization. Note that this session
      is coding intensive. It is advisable that you understand datatypes and OOP
      concepts before attending. Tutor: Mike Geig

    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7R3xiy8HDY
    channelName: Unity
    description: "Check out UFPS 2 here: https://ole.unity.com/ufps2\n\nIn this series
      of 3 videos, we're going to take a look at an overview of UFPS 2, and see how
      we can use a wide set of options and features to add an FPS controller into
      our Unity projects.\n\nThe Ultimate First Person Shooter (UFPS) is your ultimate
      solution for creating ANY first person shooter game. It is a professional,
      deterministic character controller designed to include the smoothest first
      person controls and to excel in all areas: PC, mobile, console, AI, networking,
      and VR. \n\nUFPS version 2 was built from the ground up leveraging the best
      parts of version 1 of our controllers, which have been on the Asset Store for
      many years and have resulted in a solid code base. A no compromises approach
      was taken during development when determining how to implement a feature: opting
      to have an extremely polished asset instead of quickly rushing a particular
      feature out the door. \n\nA wide variety of shootable weapons such as a rocket
      launcher, sniper, and bow & arrow are included. The spring system is the heart
      of first person perspective adding bobs, shakes, and sways to the camera/items.
      The editor scripts allow you to create your character and items in seconds.
      The ability system comes with over 20 abilities or add your own functionality
      without having to change any of the included scripts. Up may not always be
      up with the adjustable dynamic gravity system. Full body awareness is supported.
      UFPS comes with more than 200 pages of documentation plus tutorial videos to
      help you easily get started on your project."

      we created as an example of how to use Unity Services in a mobile game. It
      also contains some useful examples of coding architecture and techniques for
      solving common game programming problems. \n\nAnd now, our demo team have reworked
      the Trash Dash project, and made it compatible with the Lightweight Render

  - title: 'Adding Weapons - Unity 2018: UFPS 2 Overview (2/3)'
    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHpzREXV4mE
    channelName: Unity
    description: "Check out UFPS 2 here: https://ole.unity.com/ufps2\n\nIn this series
      of 3 videos, we're going to take a look at an overview of UFPS 2, and see how
      we can use a wide set of options and features to add an FPS controller into
      our Unity projects.\n\nThe Ultimate First Person Shooter (UFPS) is your ultimate
      solution for creating ANY first person shooter game. It is a professional,
      deterministic character controller designed to include the smoothest first
      person controls and to excel in all areas: PC, mobile, console, AI, networking,
      and VR. \n\nUFPS version 2 was built from the ground up leveraging the best
      parts of version 1 of our controllers, which have been on the Asset Store for
      many years and have resulted in a solid code base. A no compromises approach
      was taken during development when determining how to implement a feature: opting
      to have an extremely polished asset instead of quickly rushing a particular
      feature out the door. \n\nA wide variety of shootable weapons such as a rocket
      launcher, sniper, and bow & arrow are included. The spring system is the heart
      of first person perspective adding bobs, shakes, and sways to the camera/items.
      The editor scripts allow you to create your character and items in seconds.
      The ability system comes with over 20 abilities or add your own functionality
      without having to change any of the included scripts. Up may not always be
      up with the adjustable dynamic gravity system. Full body awareness is supported.
      UFPS comes with more than 200 pages of documentation plus tutorial videos to
      help you easily get started on your project."
