      in Homeworld Shipbreakers'
    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNR9Nvjsv9Y
    channelName: Unity
    description: 'Homeworld: Shipbreakers is a real-time strategy game in which hundreds
      of massive vehicles battle it out over the surface of a vast desert planet,
      harvesting resources from crashed spaceships as they struggle for survival
      in a harsh environment. This talk discusses the cinematic tools and procedural
      camera systems used to create beautiful cut-scenes of actors with varying performances.


      Developing
      an NIS, or cut-scene, generally begins with hand-keying cameras. This is great
      when your actors perform exactly the same things each time, but what happens
      if they are AI driven agents, the level changes, or if their behavior is dynamic?
      Blackbird Interactive (BBI) has developed a suite of filmmaker-style tools
      to procedurally control subject framing and camera movement. These systems
      emulate the way a cameraman composes shots and adapts to changes in actor performances
      and the surrounding environment.


      This talk will demonstrate how we
      used procedural cameras to showcase the beauty of Homeworld: Shipbreakers and
      effectively compose our dynamic vehicle behaviours. The mechanics of the cameras
      will be deconstructed and shown live in-editor. It should be of interest to
      anyone involved with gameplay cameras or cinematic presentation. More about

    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIf3-aDTOOA

    description: "S.O.L.I.D. is a collection of 5 programming principles that allow
      you to build larger applications, while keeping the code maintainable, flexible
      and, in general, with fewer bugs. The business world has enjoyed this in many
      languages for many years, but may seem impossible in Unity. Productive Edge
      explains what each of the five principles mean, along with examples, and most
      importantly, how to apply them in your own Unity coding. \n\nThis talk also
      covers two great features as part of S.O.L.I.D. First, the use of DLL's instead
      of Scripts (optional), which allow you to add Unit Tests via MSTest or NUnit.
      Normally, this is impossible because of Unity's object duality (.NET/C++) throwing
      errors outside of Unity, but this talk teaches you how to get around that.
      Second, how to implement a Dependency Injection system, similar to Ninject,
      but designed for Unity, without requiring the designers to understand DI programming.\n\nDan
      Sagmiller (Senior VR Solutions Architect, Productive Edge)"

      Visual Vertical
      Slices. A powerful concept to sell a videogame that sets the mood, the visual
      feeling, the atmosphere and the tone of a project. It''s like a candy to the
      viewer, a powerful claim that sells the game. The Nautilus Odyssey - Visual
      Vertical Slice was done in Unity in only 1,5 month by a team of two 3D Artists,
      one Animator and one designer in their spare time. This talk covers creating
      a Virtual Vertical Slice that sells a concept, the narrative, the environmental
      storytelling, the production plan, the development of assets, the visual rhythm,
      the art direction... and of course the help and agility to prototype that Unity
      can bring in such a short amount of time for the artists.'

      make this possible, such as the hardware sensors and some of the software algorithms.
      We will also show demonstrations of current state of the technology, the developer
      SDK, partner applications, and discuss the role of 3D sensing in mobile gaming,
      indoor navigation, virtual reality, and augmented reality.

    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxj9Va6EYxI

    description: 'Movement in VR is challenging. When a player''s avatar moves differently
      to the player''s body in real life, the brain receives conflicting signals
      from its senses. Placing players in a virtual cockpit can help significantly,
      abstracting the motion to a vehicle rather than the body. However the brain
      still expects to experience rotational and lateral forces from the motion of
      the vehicle. In developing the VR version of Sublevel Zero, a six-degree-of-freedom
      shooter, you need to work out how to allow players complete freedom of movement,
      without needing to throw up. This talk, given by Gary Lloyd and Luke Thompson
      (Sigtrap Ltd), explain their experiences with vehicle motion in VR, and how
      they have solved the problems that it''s presented. Sublevel Zero''s six axis
      motion allows them to give a generalised perspective on almost any type of
      vehicular movement.

    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rtpm_F9GXk

    description: 'This talk presents a qualitative study with the purpose to evaluate
      users'' perceptions of an immersive virtual reality (IVR) scenario in which
      they evaluate the appearance and functionality of myoelectric prostheses. Seven
      people with transradial upper limb deficiency participated in the study that
      involved trying out a virtual kitchen environment using a Oculus rift headset.
      Each participant tested three virtual prosthetic models that could be controlled
      by a Myo armband placed around their stump. The IVR scenario was evaluated
      positively and enabled users to evaluate the appearance of the prosthesis designs
      and the grip function of a virtual myoelectric prosthesis. Users were all able
      to grasp, even if they had not previously been trained to use a myoelectric
      device. The system showed considerable promise for use as an affordable, portable,
      myoelectric prosthesis-training tool. The ecologically valid context of the
      training may both facilitate learning and make it more enjoyable and efficient.

    channelName: Unity
    description: 'At Unite Copenhagen, this session looked at traditional accident-awareness
      training methods, like filling out multiple-choice webforms or listening to
      presentations, fail to drive meaningful engagement among construction workers
      regarding the risks of their job. In this session, learn from Skanska and OutHere
      how worker-safety training conducted in virtual reality (VR), including putting
      participants "at-risk" in a simulated environment, drives behavioral change
      that ultimately creates safer construction sites.

      humanoid robot on the International Space Station, to navigation techniques,
      and most recently to exploration of believable virtual characters. As we continue
      to expand our scope, we\u2019re looking to ways to bridge the gap between the

    description: "The recently introduced Vive Tracker -- which enables motion tracking
      of objects in VR -- has already inspired a diverse range of use cases from
      tracking baseball bats, to bringing mobile into VR, to attaching the Tracker
      on a camera enabling the user to take photos inside VR. \n\nAs consumer VR
      enters its second year, developers are constantly pushing the limits of understanding
      for VR across in and out of home entertainment, and now they have an entirely
      new way to pair physical objects with the VR environment across all of SteamVR
      and OpenVR. This means more ways for developers to monetize their content,
      build unique VR experiences for third parties, and even bring hardware accessories
      into the VR ecosystem in retail. \n\nVinay Narayan (HTC Vive) highlights how
      the Vive Tracker can be used from a hardware and software perspective to improve
      VR experiences. The Vive Tracker enables developers to motion track objects
      in VR without the need for other expensive products or software.\n\nSpeaker:\nVinay
