      Core Set Up\nSet up Unity and the LEGO Microgame on your computer\nhttps://on.unity.com/36qwHPp\n\nIf
      you have questions, reach out to us in the GameJam chat on Discord https://discord.com/invite/unity\n================================\n\nFAQs:\nQ:
      Do I need any Unity or programming experience to attend?\nA: Nope! This jam
      is for people who are new to Unity. We just ask that you arrive ready to jam
      (see above).\n\nQ: What are the system requirements to install Unity?\nA: https://on.unity.com/3fzPkUs\n\nQ:
      How long is the jam?\nA: We\u2019ll be jamming for about 2-2.5 hours. Of course,
      you\u2019re free to pop in and out. We\u2019ll do our best to make sure it\u2019s
      easy for people to just jump right back in with us!\n\nQ: Will it be recorded/published?\nA:
      Yes! The stream will be converted to a video once it ends, so you can review
      it at any time. If you missed it live, you can watch it at your convenience.\n\nQ:
      What is a game jam?\nA: This game jam is unique because it\u2019s hosted online,
      it\u2019s for beginners, we\u2019re using a game template, it\u2019s short,
      and we (pretty much) know what we\u2019re going to show you. A \u201Ctraditional\u201D
      game jam is an in-person event where you would typically gather with more experienced
      programmers, game designers, artists, etc. to create a game or project from
      scratch within a time span averaging 24\u201372 hours."
