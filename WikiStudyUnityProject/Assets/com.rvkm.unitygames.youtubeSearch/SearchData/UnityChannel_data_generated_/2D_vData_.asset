      Are you curious about ad integration with mobile games? If so, look no further!
      The Ultimate Guide to 2D Mobile Game Development with Unity teaches you how
      to create profitable and engaging mobile apps.  You\u2019ll create a dungeon
      escape adventure game using 2D animations, while fine-tuning your C# programming
      skills with intermediate concepts like class inheritance, abstract classes,
      and interfaces! You\u2019ll utilize the Singleton design manager to create
      powerful manager classes that help delegate actions in your game.  You will
      learn how to monetize your game by integrating Unity Ads, and you\u2019ll set
      up a system to reward the player for choosing to watch an ad! Finally, you
      will learn how to publish your app to the Google Play Store! By the end of
      this course, you will have experience with the complete mobile and software
      development life cycle, from game development, to testing, and publishing! 
      You will have a fully finished, downloadable game to show off to your friends
      and family, or to add to your portfolio if you are pursuing mobile development
      professionally!\n\nIn this course, you will:\n\nCreate a 2D Dungeon Adventure
      Game\n\nExplore the new 2D TileMap Features\n\nImplement Unity Ads\n\nSynthesize

      SpriteShape
      is a sprite layout or world building tool that provides the ability to tile
      sprites along the path of a shape based on given angle ranges. Additionally
      the shape can be filled with a tiling texture.


      The main feature of
      the SpriteShape is the powerful combination of a bezier spline path with the
      ability to tile Sprites adaptively or continuously while automatically switching
      Sprites assigned to given angles.'

      procedures we can perform in Shader Graph and how we can use noise and textures
      to perform and influence different operations within our shaders.\n\nCheck

      Unity Online User Group'

    channelName: Unity

      Improved
      workflow


      The new Prefab workflows, which are now available as previews,
      allow you to split up scenes and Prefabs on a granular level. This gives you
      greater flexibility, increases your productivity and enables you to work confidently
      without worrying about making time-consuming errors.


      The improvements
      are based on surveys with more than 150 enterprise customers, numerous interviews,
      several usability tests and two game jams. The long-term goal has been not
      only to implement support for nesting, but to rethink the core Prefab workflows
      so different team members can simultaneously edit Prefabs confidently and efficiently.




      Nesting


      Previously,
      users were forced to choose between creating large monolithic Prefabs, like
      buildings, or more granular ones, like pieces of furniture, but they couldn''t
      do both.


      Now with support for nested Prefabs, a large building can
      be made up of many smaller room Prefabs, which in turn can be made up of multiple
      pieces of furniture Prefabs, and so on.


      This makes it easier for teams
      of all sizes to:


      Split up Prefabs into multiple entities for greater
      efficiency

      Reuse any content, from small to large

      Work on different
      parts of content simultaneously

      Learn more

      Prefab Variants

      Flexible
      properties increase efficiency

      As a default, a Prefab Variant inherits
      the objects and properties of the Prefab it is a variant of, but at the same
      time, you have the possibility to override those properties. This is similar
      to the concept of inheritance in object-oriented programming.


      For example,
      if you had multiple door Prefabs, you could choose to make some of them a different
      color, while allowing the rest to inherit the existing Prefab color property.
      Any change made to the original door Prefab will affect the variants of it
      as well, except those properties which have been overridden.



      Prefab
      Mode

      Avoid time-consuming mistakes

      A cornerstone of the new workflows,
      Prefab Mode enables you to edit in isolation. While this means that you will
      have to approach Prefab editing in a slightly different way, you can feel secure
      that any errors made will not have negative consequences.'

      You''ve
      probably seen the sample 2D assets, watched the infinite runner presentation,
      and played around with the 2D tools in Unity. That''s all well and good if
      you want to make side scrolling 2D games, but what about top-down 2D games?
      In this session we are going to look at making top-down style 2D games in Unity.
      We will examine the ways to build scenes, ways to control characters, and some
      of the more confusing elements of the top-down style (including things like
      attacking). "Stabbing" is the new "explosions". Tutor: Mike Geig

      this session, we will prototype and build the foundations of an infinite runner.
      We will try to cover as much as possible in the time we have. This game will
      be a platformer / runner using Unity''s 2D tools. Come check it out! Tutor:

    channelName: Unity
    description: 'Get started with Sprite Shape: https://on.unity.com/SpriteShapeBlog

      Find
      out more about Sprite Shape: http://ole.unity.com/spriteshape


      SpriteShape
      is a sprite layout or world building tool that provides the ability to tile
      sprites along the path of a shape based on given angle ranges. Additionally
      the shape can be filled with a tiling texture.


      The main feature of
      the SpriteShape is the powerful combination of a bezier spline path with the
      ability to tile Sprites adaptively or continuously while automatically switching
      Sprites assigned to given angles.'

    channelName: Unity
    description: 'Find out more about Sprite Shape: http://ole.unity.com/spriteshape


      SpriteShape
      is a sprite layout or world building tool that provides the ability to tile
      sprites along the path of a shape based on given angle ranges. Additionally
      the shape can be filled with a tiling texture.


      The main feature of
      the SpriteShape is the powerful combination of a bezier spline path with the
      ability to tile Sprites adaptively or continuously while automatically switching
      Sprites assigned to given angles.'

      In
      this live session we will explore worldbuilding in 2D using Tilemap and 2D
      Cinemachine. Tilemap makes it fast and easy to create and iterate level design
      cycles right in Unity, so artists and designers can rapidly prototype when
      building 2D game worlds. We will look at how you can paint levels using the
      new tile and brush tools which allow you to define rules for how tiles behave
      when placed, creating platforms with dynamic edges, animated tiles, random
      tiles, and more. Cinemachine, is a dynamic, procedural camera system which
      it easy to automate composition and tracking to enhance gameplay. Cinemachine
      is now available for 2D games. In this segment we will look at how to use Rule
      tiles from 2D Extras to design 2D levels.'

      2D Roguelike project guides you through creating a turn based, tile based game
      with procedurally generated levels. In the game you play as a lone man trying
      to find food and survive the waste land for as long as you can.


      This
      is part 9 of 14 in which we write the Player script to allow movement, picking
      up powerups and exiting the level.

      This
      2D Roguelike project guides you through creating a turn based, tile based game
      with procedurally generated levels. In the game you play as a lone man trying
      to find food and survive the waste land for as long as you can.


      This
      is part 11 of 14 in which we set up our enemy animator controller.
