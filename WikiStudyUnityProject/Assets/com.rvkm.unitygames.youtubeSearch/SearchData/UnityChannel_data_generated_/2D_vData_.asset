      Are you curious about ad integration with mobile games? If so, look no further!
      The Ultimate Guide to 2D Mobile Game Development with Unity teaches you how
      to create profitable and engaging mobile apps.  You\u2019ll create a dungeon
      escape adventure game using 2D animations, while fine-tuning your C# programming
      skills with intermediate concepts like class inheritance, abstract classes,
      and interfaces! You\u2019ll utilize the Singleton design manager to create
      powerful manager classes that help delegate actions in your game.  You will
      learn how to monetize your game by integrating Unity Ads, and you\u2019ll set
      up a system to reward the player for choosing to watch an ad! Finally, you
      will learn how to publish your app to the Google Play Store! By the end of
      this course, you will have experience with the complete mobile and software
      development life cycle, from game development, to testing, and publishing! 
      You will have a fully finished, downloadable game to show off to your friends
      and family, or to add to your portfolio if you are pursuing mobile development
      professionally!\n\nIn this course, you will:\n\nCreate a 2D Dungeon Adventure
      Game\n\nExplore the new 2D TileMap Features\n\nImplement Unity Ads\n\nSynthesize
      Animation State Behaviors\n\nDevelop 2D Animation Hitboxes\n\nPublish to the

      You''ve
      probably seen the sample 2D assets, watched the infinite runner presentation,
      and played around with the 2D tools in Unity. That''s all well and good if
      you want to make side scrolling 2D games, but what about top-down 2D games?
      In this session we are going to look at making top-down style 2D games in Unity.
      We will examine the ways to build scenes, ways to control characters, and some
      of the more confusing elements of the top-down style (including things like
      attacking). "Stabbing" is the new "explosions". Tutor: Mike Geig

    description: 'Let''s Make a Game (LMG). With the Global Game Jam fast approaching,
      we figured it would be a cool idea to walk through the creation of a game.
      With that in mind, we present the infinite runner in one hour challenge. During
      this session, we will prototype and build the foundations of an infinite runner.
      We will try to cover as much as possible in the time we have. This game will
      be a platformer / runner using Unity''s 2D tools. Come check it out! Tutor:

      The
      Distance Joint 2D allows a sprite controlled by 2D Physics to rotate around
      a point, but maintain a certain distance from that point. In this video, we
      cover the basics of the 2D Distance Joint and how to use it.

      In
      this live training session we will learn a workflow for laying out a simple
      2D scene using 2D sorting groups, sprite meshes and 9-Slice sprites introduced
      in Unity 5.6. We will use these tools to create a simple 2D game. In this episode
      we will take a quick look at the 2D physics reference project created by Melvyn
      May which demonstrates how to use each of Unity''s 2D physics features.'

      In
      this live session we will explore worldbuilding in 2D using Tilemap and 2D
      Cinemachine. Tilemap makes it fast and easy to create and iterate level design
      cycles right in Unity, so artists and designers can rapidly prototype when
      building 2D game worlds. We will look at how you can paint levels using the
      new tile and brush tools which allow you to define rules for how tiles behave
      when placed, creating platforms with dynamic edges, animated tiles, random
      tiles, and more. Cinemachine, is a dynamic, procedural camera system which
      it easy to automate composition and tracking to enhance gameplay. Cinemachine
      is now available for 2D games. In this segment we will look at how to use Rule
      tiles from 2D Extras to design 2D levels.'

      http://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/2d-roguelike


      This
      2D Roguelike project guides you through creating a turn based, tile based game
      with procedurally generated levels. In the game you play as a lone man trying
      to find food and survive the waste land for as long as you can.


      This
      is part 9 of 14 in which we write the Player script to allow movement, picking
      up powerups and exiting the level.

      with procedurally generated levels. In the game you play as a lone man trying
      to find food and survive the waste land for as long as you can.


      This
      is part 8 of 14 in which we set up the Player animator controller to control
      the player''s animations.

      2D Roguelike project guides you through creating a turn based, tile based game
      with procedurally generated levels. In the game you play as a lone man trying
      to find food and survive the waste land for as long as you can.


      This
      is part 10 of 14 in which we write the script for our enemy units including
      movement and basic AI.
