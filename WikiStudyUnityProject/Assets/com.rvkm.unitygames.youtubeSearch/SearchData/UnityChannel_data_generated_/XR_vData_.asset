      Mobile XR
    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsgcuZkCQv0
    channelName: Unity
    description: 'Many companies have existing 3D assets and want to leverage those
      CAD/CAM, editorial and other 3D models also in interactive immersive scenarios.
      But rendering those complex models in real-time poses an interesting challenge
      with mobile VR/AR/MR development and devices like HoloLens which have limited
      computing power. How can those insanely large polygonal models be optimized
      to fit into the rendering budget of a mobile device? In this session Rene Schulte
      will answer that question and provides best practices. He and his team is working
      with the HoloLens since 2015 with many clients that faced similar challenges.
      Rene distilled 3 key approaches and will demonstrate them also with Mixed Reality
      live demos on-stage.

      Unity Be Part of the Future
    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbsmKVSSLM8
    channelName: Unity
    description: 'With the fast developments of powerful Augmented, Mixed and Virtual
      reality devices like HoloLens science fiction movie technology is becoming
      reality for consumers. In this session, Rene Schulte (IdentityMine) talks about
      the challenges that AR and VR pose and why 3D is an essential part of this
      experience. Comprehensible demos show how every developer can develop outstanding
      HoloLens solutions with Unity and be part of this computing revolution. This
      session helps you to understand how to setup your Unity environment, what skills
      you need to create compelling HoloLens applications and what are the best practices
      to move forward quickly. Starting with a simple "MR Hello World" demo, we use
      this to understand all of the pieces required to run your app. Last, but not
      least, we demonstrate some of the applications that Rene and his team have
      been working on in the past few months, to give the viewers a sense of what
      can be accomplished with the right skill targeting one of the most anticipated
      devices in a while. This session presents the challenges we faced while building
      HoloLens apps and how we solved them. Additionally, best practices and recommendations
      to avoid pit falls are discussed.

    description: "The Effekt-Etage is specialized in high-end 3D visualizations in
      the field of Consulting, CGI and Interactive. For our biggest client BMW, we
      are creating CGI, Configurator content, Animations and Apps, including innovative
      and multiple award winning Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality Apps, based
      on Unity technology. In this presentation Bj\xF6rn Kowalski (Effekt-Etage GmbH)
      and Daniel Blo\xDFfeld (Effekt-Etage GmbH) are focusing on two major Unity-based
      Apps we created for the BMW Group in the last year: BMW 7 Series Augmented
      Reality App and the BMW i Samsung Virtual Drive. Our BMW Individual 7 Series
      Augmented Reality App enables you to generate a fascinating blend of reality
      and imagination, which allows you to express your personal style. Configure
      your car interactively and admire it realistically in original size wherever
      you want to. You can freely move around your vehicle, experiencing the subtleties
      within the colors of the paint and admiring details of the new 7 Series Individual
      in original size. The BMW i Samsung Virtual Drive Experience connects the world
      of the Smart Home with the world of Smart Mobility into an overall experience
      of Smart Living and the Internet of Things. The Samsung and BMW i VR App contains
      a virtual product presentation and emotional BMW i test drive, combining live
      action material and full-CGI-images into an interactive 360-degree stereoscopic
      app. It utilizes Samsung's flagship phone's abilities as well as their Gear
      VR set and gives them visual excellence through a never seen before mobile
      VR experience. Furthermore it allows you to freely configure your car before
      your starting your test drive.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/V6Zj/"
