      augmented reality (AR) portals in Unity with inside-out tracking to allow audiences
      to step through a story. Their latest, award-winning app, \"Clean A\\R,\" showcases
      this journalistic approach, visualizing air pollution using real-time air quality

    description: 'The Game Equation workshop is an activity to do with clients to
      come up with game ideas. It produces some robust ideas that are thoroughly
      thought through. But the process takes about a week. VICKY (Values, Interests,
      Crazy 8s, Keepers, Yes and) is a series of exercises you can go through in
      about an hour with a team of 5. It takes the concepts of the Game Equation
      workshop and turns it into a brief guided brainstorming session designed for
      progress and to avoid gridlock. This produces game ideas that are a bit higher
      level than a weeklong workshop, but it can put you on a great path. Learn how
      to use VICKY. In this video, you''ll gain an understanding of each step so
      that you can mold this workshop to your own needs.

      introduced with the Entity Component System (ECS) is unfamiliar. While ECS
      clearly enables high-performance, massive-scale game worlds, creating complicated
      game mechanics can be difficult. \n\nThe Metropolis Traffic Simulation achieves
      both scale and complexity on mobile. This session focuses on the details of
      its development and how to tackle common problems like pathfinding, collision

      project lead, Lina Zdruli, is an expert is using business for social good and
      creating intercultural understanding through technology interactions. The VRefugees
      team chose VR as a means of immersing the user in realistic, 3D narration to
      eliminate the sense of detachment sometimes felt when watching humanitarian-themed
      documentaries. The user experiences the journey as if they were the refugee
      themselves to increase empathy and eliminate detachment, a common theme in
      some of the 360* videos made of refugee camps or rescuers assisting people
      off the boats landing in Greece.

    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rtpm_F9GXk
    channelName: Unity
    description: 'This talk presents a qualitative study with the purpose to evaluate
      users'' perceptions of an immersive virtual reality (IVR) scenario in which
      they evaluate the appearance and functionality of myoelectric prostheses. Seven
      people with transradial upper limb deficiency participated in the study that
      involved trying out a virtual kitchen environment using a Oculus rift headset.
      Each participant tested three virtual prosthetic models that could be controlled
      by a Myo armband placed around their stump. The IVR scenario was evaluated
      positively and enabled users to evaluate the appearance of the prosthesis designs
      and the grip function of a virtual myoelectric prosthesis. Users were all able
      to grasp, even if they had not previously been trained to use a myoelectric
      device. The system showed considerable promise for use as an affordable, portable,
      myoelectric prosthesis-training tool. The ecologically valid context of the
      training may both facilitate learning and make it more enjoyable and efficient.

    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJO9qTjR3UI
    channelName: Unity
    description: 'Being able to create 3D models and surfaces on the fly is a powerful
      part of the Unity API that is often overlooked. These techniques are especially
      useful for games and apps using procedural content but it can also be used
      to create more powerful tools for making hand crafted experiences. In this
      talk Alexander Birke (Out Of Bounds Games) describes: 1. The basics of how
      Unity''s mesh API works 2. Practical examples of games where he has used procedural
      meshes to achieve novel gameplay and aesthetics such as a 1 draw call 2D deferred
      lighting system, morphable physics colliders, improved line rendering and polygonal
      procedural levels. 3. Common strategies to assign triangle indices, the most
      tricky part of the process 4. General tips on achieving better performance
      with the mesh API for both dynamic and static meshes'

    description: 'With the fast developments of powerful Augmented, Mixed and Virtual
      reality devices like HoloLens science fiction movie technology is becoming
      reality for consumers. In this session, Rene Schulte (IdentityMine) talks about
      the challenges that AR and VR pose and why 3D is an essential part of this
      experience. Comprehensible demos show how every developer can develop outstanding
      HoloLens solutions with Unity and be part of this computing revolution. This
      session helps you to understand how to setup your Unity environment, what skills
      you need to create compelling HoloLens applications and what are the best practices
      to move forward quickly. Starting with a simple "MR Hello World" demo, we use
      this to understand all of the pieces required to run your app. Last, but not
      least, we demonstrate some of the applications that Rene and his team have
      been working on in the past few months, to give the viewers a sense of what
      can be accomplished with the right skill targeting one of the most anticipated
      devices in a while. This session presents the challenges we faced while building
      HoloLens apps and how we solved them. Additionally, best practices and recommendations
      to avoid pit falls are discussed.

    description: 'Artificial intelligence in games is back! An increasing number
      of games from AAA titles to small indies games are realizing that the advances
      in AI technology are opening up new opportunities for games to improve gameplay
      and launch entirely new genres of games. In this talk, Jakob Rasmussen (Apex
      Game Tools) shows cases emerging AI and bleeding-edge AI technologies as well
      as shows some of the emerging tools that bridge the chasm between the design-based
      technologies dominating the industry, and the new machine learning paradigm
      that still escapes most game products. In this context, we provide advice on
      how indie game developers can take advantage of the available technologies
      to overcome some of the barriers that are particular to indie game development.

      game based on an existing brand. When starting the development of The Walking
      Dead: No Man''s Land, the team decided to not only reflect the television IP''s
      look and feel in the game, but also model the brand in terms of game mechanics.
      The intent of the team was to provide the players with tough choices, as if
      you were living in a world infested with walkers. This resulted in the team
      marrying turn based combat mechanics married with rich character development
      system, simplified to be accessible as a mobile game. In this talk Joonas Laakso
      (Next Games) explores the choices made by the team, resulting in the game climbing
      to #1 download position in US App Store. The audience gains insight into approaching
      IP based games from game design perspective, where the game intends to reflect
      the essence of the brand through the overall player experience.

    description: 'Unity''s large and friendly user community is often cited as one
      of its greatest strengths, with the active online forums providing a wealth
      of information, experience, and advice for users. However, if the only time
      you log on is to ask for technical help or to promote your newly-launched game,
      you''re missing out on many potential opportunities that community involvement
      can bring. In this session, Alastair Aitchison (Norfolk Game Developers) describes
      some of the benefits he''s experienced from involvement with online and local
      game development communities - forming teams, receiving job offers, developing
      a featured asset, gaining coverage in national media, and making friends -
      and gives you some tips as to how you too can profit from being an active part
      of a community.

    description: 'Movement in VR is challenging. When a player''s avatar moves differently
      to the player''s body in real life, the brain receives conflicting signals
      from its senses. Placing players in a virtual cockpit can help significantly,
      abstracting the motion to a vehicle rather than the body. However the brain
      still expects to experience rotational and lateral forces from the motion of
      the vehicle. In developing the VR version of Sublevel Zero, a six-degree-of-freedom
      shooter, you need to work out how to allow players complete freedom of movement,
      without needing to throw up. This talk, given by Gary Lloyd and Luke Thompson
      (Sigtrap Ltd), explain their experiences with vehicle motion in VR, and how
      they have solved the problems that it''s presented. Sublevel Zero''s six axis
      motion allows them to give a generalised perspective on almost any type of
      vehicular movement.

    description: 'Albion Online is a cross-platform sandbox MMO RPG game. David Salz
      (Sandbox Interactive) takes you behind the (technical) scenes. He takes a look
      at the structure of the server farm and its inner workings, the databases,
      the threading and message processing model and many other interesting implementation
      aspects. On the client side, Albion uses the well-known Unity game engine.
      The second part of the talk describes how they use Unity! Audience addressed:
      Programmers interested in online or MMO games. The talk is suitable for beginners,
      but some aspect of it will assume experience with threading and a basic understanding
      of SQL / NoSQL databases. Takeaway: - learn about the architecture of a modern
      MMO game, including aspects like scalability - learn how to use Unity in a
      big game project without making the core game logic depend on Unity

    channelName: Unity
    description: 'We all know how Free-To-Play design has elevated the mobile games
      industry to new heights; but beneath the monetisation is a quieter revolution.
      The use of analytics. Using data to understand players allows us to create
      better, more targeted, more responsive games. It also helps give us more insight
      to make sure that we get the most profitable return on the game - so we can
      keep adding and improving to this and future games. In this session, Oscar
      Clark Evangelist at Unity Technologies, shares lessons from his 18 years of
      running profitable games services focused on one key perspective - the Player
      Lifecycle. He shows how Player&#39;s needs change over time and that we need
      to ensure our game responds and adapts to them in order to maximise retention,
      monetisation and even acquisition. He explores the key data points which allow
      us to recognise the most dangerous moments in the lifecycle of a player as
      they move from Discovery to Learning, then Engaging and finally Churning. How
      can we recognise when players enter these stages? and what we can do to help
      maximise their enjoyment of the game? Only by paying attention to the data
      can we give our game the best chance of success. This session helps learning
      about: - A Practical Guide To Using Analytics In Your Games - Understanding
      The Player Lifecycle: Discovery, Learning, Engaging, Churning - What Do Custom
      Events and Custom Segment Allow us to do? - Using Analytics to improve the

      a $5 asset and spending 30 minutes fixing makes way more sense than spending
      an entire day modelling and texturing everything from scratch. Sosowski shares

      Visual Vertical
      Slices. A powerful concept to sell a videogame that sets the mood, the visual
      feeling, the atmosphere and the tone of a project. It''s like a candy to the
      viewer, a powerful claim that sells the game. The Nautilus Odyssey - Visual
      Vertical Slice was done in Unity in only 1,5 month by a team of two 3D Artists,
      one Animator and one designer in their spare time. This talk covers creating
      a Virtual Vertical Slice that sells a concept, the narrative, the environmental
      storytelling, the production plan, the development of assets, the visual rhythm,
      the art direction... and of course the help and agility to prototype that Unity
      can bring in such a short amount of time for the artists.'

    description: "S.O.L.I.D. is a collection of 5 programming principles that allow
      you to build larger applications, while keeping the code maintainable, flexible
      and, in general, with fewer bugs. The business world has enjoyed this in many
      languages for many years, but may seem impossible in Unity. Productive Edge
      explains what each of the five principles mean, along with examples, and most
      importantly, how to apply them in your own Unity coding. \n\nThis talk also
      covers two great features as part of S.O.L.I.D. First, the use of DLL's instead
      of Scripts (optional), which allow you to add Unit Tests via MSTest or NUnit.
      Normally, this is impossible because of Unity's object duality (.NET/C++) throwing
      errors outside of Unity, but this talk teaches you how to get around that.
      Second, how to implement a Dependency Injection system, similar to Ninject,
      but designed for Unity, without requiring the designers to understand DI programming.\n\nDan
      Sagmiller (Senior VR Solutions Architect, Productive Edge)"

  - title: Unite Austin 2017 - How To Scale CPU Systems Dynamically
    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mol-WPnstY
    channelName: Unity
    description: 'Low, medium, and high: Standard fare for GPU settings, but why
      not CPU? Today the power of the CPU on end uers'' machines can vary wildly.
      Typically, developers will define their CPU min-spec, implement the simulation
      and gameplay systems using that performance target, and call it a day. This
      leaves the many potentially available cores built-in to modern mainstream CPUs
      sitting idle on the sideline. In this talk, Intel shares which systems in Unity
      are CPU scalable. Learn how to easily determine the power of the CPU in your
      scripts when enabling and configuraing those systems. Giving your players the
      best experience possible on all levels of hardware is the ultimate goal, and
      now it''s easier than ever.

    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LTDFwWMlqQ
    channelName: Unity
    description: 'Being able to create 3D models and surfaces on the fly is a powerful
      part of the Unity API that is often overlooked. These techniques are especially
      useful for games and apps using procedural content but it can also be used
      to create more powerful tools for making hand crafted experiences. In this
      talk Alexander Birke (Out Of Bounds Games) describes: 1. The basics of how
      Unity''s mesh API works 2. Practical examples of games where he has used procedural
      meshes to achieve novel gameplay and aesthetics such as a 1 draw call 2D deferred
      lighting system, morphable physics colliders, improved line rendering and polygonal
      procedural levels. 3. Common strategies to assign triangle indices, the most
      tricky part of the process 4. General tips on achieving better performance
      with the mesh API for both dynamic and static meshes'

      in Unity 5'
    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsGZ83sQyBI
    channelName: Unity
    description: 'Many platforms, like VR and mobile, place high demands on developers
      to meet acceptable framerates or else risk failure. Often, the art assets in
      a Unity project looks fantastic but no matter how optimized the codebase is,
      the build just doesn''t meet the desired frame rate. Unoptimized art assets,
      including some art which may be purchased on the Asset Store, can seriously
      hinder performance on demanding platforms. In this session, we will highlight
      some red flags to lookout for in a variety of art asset types and identify
      key optimizations that can be implemented into your art pipeline to significantly
      increase performance on demanding platforms. Art asset types covered will include:


      *
      3D Models, Animations and Rigs

      * 2D Textures and Sprites

      * Materials
      and Shaders

    description: 'Allegorithmic develops the new generation of 3D texturing software:
      Substance Painter, Substance Designer and Bitmap2Material. With most AAA game
      studios using these tools (and many indies), Substance has become the industry
      standard for creating next-generation PBR (Physically Based Rendering) assets.
      Indeed, Photoshop is becoming less and less relevant for game developers since
      the rise of PBR, which is native in Unity 5.


      In this session, we will
      talk about PBR (Physically Base Rendering) in Unity 5 and give a live demo
      of workflows to create PBR-ready textures.

  - title: Unite 2015 - How To Design Fairer Games IAP
    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCZa0OEnXoM
    channelName: Unity
    description: 'Effective game monetization is about more than just throwing In-App
      Purchase (IAP) items into your game and hoping for the best. Today, too many
      Free2Play developers have left their players feeling uncomfortable about spending
      money through poor game design: so much so that for many gamers, avoiding paying
      has become half of the fun.

      The problem is too many game designers fail
      to appreciate that players don''t buy IAP just because they "like" our games
      - they buy because they expect future value in our games. And in order to maximize
      this sense of value, even our IAP-related design choices must be geared towards
      enhancing our players'' desire to continue playing our game. Lifetime Value
      (LTV) is about focusing on the lifetime of the player, not just how much money
      we can extract from them in the short term.

      This tale will explore what
      influences our players'' decisions to keep playing and spend money in games
      by focusing on their delight using effective game design techniques that deepen
      player engagement.

      Join us to learn how you can approach IAPs more creatively
      and to build more effective monetization while still respecting (and not angering)
      your players.

    channelName: Unity
    description: 'Augmented reality opens new opportunities for Unity developers
      beyond gaming and entertainment. AR is projected to eclipse virtual reality
      and become a $100 billion industry over the next decade. We are only beginning
      to explore how practical applications of AR in science, medicine, engineering,
      commerce and education can improve lives. Augmented reality connects the digital
      and physical worlds with the human brain. The diverse and deep knowledge developers
      need to build these applications spans sensory perception, computer vision,
      physics, tracking and statistical data analysis, and more. This talk provides
      concrete demonstrations using the Meta platform and lessons learned from Meta
      engineers.

      in Homeworld Shipbreakers'
    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNR9Nvjsv9Y
    channelName: Unity
    description: 'Homeworld: Shipbreakers is a real-time strategy game in which hundreds
      of massive vehicles battle it out over the surface of a vast desert planet,
      harvesting resources from crashed spaceships as they struggle for survival
      in a harsh environment. This talk discusses the cinematic tools and procedural
      camera systems used to create beautiful cut-scenes of actors with varying performances.


      Developing
      an NIS, or cut-scene, generally begins with hand-keying cameras. This is great
      when your actors perform exactly the same things each time, but what happens
      if they are AI driven agents, the level changes, or if their behavior is dynamic?
      Blackbird Interactive (BBI) has developed a suite of filmmaker-style tools
      to procedurally control subject framing and camera movement. These systems
      emulate the way a cameraman composes shots and adapts to changes in actor performances
      and the surrounding environment.


      This talk will demonstrate how we
      used procedural cameras to showcase the beauty of Homeworld: Shipbreakers and
      effectively compose our dynamic vehicle behaviours. The mechanics of the cameras
      will be deconstructed and shown live in-editor. It should be of interest to
      anyone involved with gameplay cameras or cinematic presentation. More about

    description: "Fungus brings your game's story to life! Add colourful characters
      and craft gripping storylines, even if you have never used Unity before. The
      intuitive visual scripting system lets everyone create beautiful story games
      without coding. \n\nEven better, Fungus is open source and completely free
      to use!\n\nIn this talk you will learn how to add common storytelling features
      from RPGs, Visual Novels and Point-and-click adventure games to your own game
      in minutes using Fungus. We'll show you how to empower the storytellers in
      your team to craft interactive story sequences without writing a single line
      of code, and how you can easily extend Fungus to customise the workflow for
      your team. We'll also share our learnings from running a free open source Unity
      project, and the amazing things that have happened since we went open source!\n\nHelp

    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ra3ouahAzM
    channelName: Unity
    description: 'Maximizing the gaming experience on a mobile device requires more
      than innovative technology and gameplay. The gaming experience is equally affected
      by your game''s ability to manage power consumption and avoid device heat ups
      as today''s consumers expect always-on connectivity and all-day battery life
      from their mobile devices. These factors can impact a game''s success by limiting
      game performance and creating an unplayable mobile experience.

      In this
      session, you''ll learn how to improve power and thermal efficiency while achieving
      maximum performance for your Unity game on Android with Snapdragon Profiler,
      an exciting new profiling tool from Qualcomm Technologies, Inc.

    description: 'This first part of this session will introduce Mono.Cecil, what
      can be done with it and what can''t, and demonstrate its usage with examples
      tailored for Unity users. Mono.Cecil is a library to analyze and manipulate
      IL code and binaries. Anytime you feel limited by the compiler of your language
      of choice, you can post-process your binaries with Cecil and reshape them into
      what you want.

      The second half of this session will demonstrate advanced
      reflection techniques to go above and beyond the Inspector. What if you want
      to see all the properties of your objects, including those with get/set accessors?
      Or you want to inspect an object that isn''t a GameObject or Component?

  - title: 'UIForia: User interface euphoria - Unite Copenhagen'
    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnxjHWEg4ek
    channelName: Unity
    description: "Picture this: Your awesome game is close to shipping, and suddenly
      you realize that you haven't implemented the player inventory screen! The truth
      is you've avoided touching the UI in your game as much as possible because
      the framework you built/borrowed/licensed/stole is too painful to work with.
      Data binding is a nightmare or just doesn't exist, the layout system is so
      complicated that you just positioned everything at exact pixel offsets by hand,
      and for some unknown reason rendering and animating UI takes 60% of your frame
      time. This is a pretty common story in the game dev world, but UIForia is fixing
      it. UIForia is a fully-featured UI Engine for Unity that offers lightning-fast
      data binding, a sophisticated yet approachable layout engine, hot reloadable
      templates, composable styling, and a very low learning curve. This session
      from Unite Copenhagen shows how UIForia is helping Klang ship one of the most
      ambitious MMO games ever.\n\nSpeaker: Matt Weichselbaum \u2013 Klang Games\n\nSlides

    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWbXDpPErkE
    channelName: Unity
    description: 'This session from Unite Copenhagen, presented in partnership with
      Google Cloud, focuses on the advantages of using cloud services for running
      simulations and other machine-learning training-related jobs that call for
      huge workloads. Many companies that are involved in simulation push the compute
      workload onto their on-premise infrastructure but this requires tremendous
      resources. Heavy-duty cloud resources are a powerful, scalable and on-demand
      alternative. Cloud provides an a-la-carte solution where compute workloads
      are profiled and deployed into an optimal specialized hardware solution that
      is tailored for the workload. It also provides a unique opportunity for the
      most innovative companies to step up their game.

    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxbSJ-EIjXI
    channelName: Unity
    description: 'Take a dive deep into the new prefab features. What''s the inside
      versus outside of a prefab? How does it relate to Prefab mode, overrides, unpacking,
      and prefab variants? How has the new prefab back-end changed? This session
      will give you a better understanding of the Prefab system, the pros and cons
      of various implementation decisions, and some Aha moments working with Prefab
      nesting.

      an isometric shooter game. You play as a young boy having a nightmare that
      his toys have come to life as members of the undead, luckily in this nightmare,
      he''s armed to the teeth!


      This is part 9 of 10, in which you will add

      during the game.

    description: 'Anton Hand (Rust Ltd) on how to structure the work of a small independent
      game development studio: "You''ve got this grand vision, and you''re beginning
      to map out your game, and then it hits you. How on earth are you going to get
      all this done?


      In this talk, we''ll be covering how an informed pre-production
      comprising aesthetic direction, modelling style, asset management, lighting
      approach, and more are the difference between success and careening into a
      brick wall. We''ll talk to making the most of your human resources, unpack
      the difference between having specialists and generalists for line-asset production,
      when and how to use the Unity Asset Store best, and what design/production
      decisions are critical to lock-in up front. Lastly, we''ll briefly cover some
      multi-platform strategies, and the sorts of things to be aware of if eventually
      planning to scale down to mobile, or scale up to VR. Expect a rapid-fire pace,
      a fair bit of ranting, and the bluntness you might expect from a veteran 3d
      modeller who''s tired of seeing great projects go off the rails.


      We
      at RUST LTD. have over the years become experts in the art of the insane small-team
      rush-project. We''ve studied and iterated on our internal production processes,
      and consulted with teams spanning Indie Games, Archviz, VR, Art Installation
      and all steps in between. Completing a limited-resource project (and really,
      aren''t they all?) can be a challenging endeavour, and we''d like to share
      the process that we''ve developed with you."

      merging real-time 3D and PLM in manufacturing. Within the manufacturing industry,
      and especially in the automotive segment, product lifecycle management (PLM)
      is a critical foundation for customer workflows. Real-time 3D needs to use
      PLM systems as a source of geometry and metadata. In this session, you'll hear
      from an expert from Atos, a leader in digital transformation, how PLM and real-time
      3D are coming together to enable powerful and efficient new workflows. \n\nSpeakers:

    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUiO64KbAHA
    channelName: Unity
    description: The introduction of mobile AR means the arrival of more accessible
      devices, and for developers, a broader range of consumers to target. The good
      news is that you're "already ready." A stable of universal techniques and best
      practices can help reduce draw calls and maximize performance without sacrificing
      fidelity across Gear VR, Oculus Go, and Project Santa Cruz. We'll start with
      an overview of the devices and basic considerations, and go step by step through
      the process of reviewing and optimizing textures, scene geometry, and lighting.
      If you're interested in Project Santa Cruz, you will also benefit from an introduction
      to Unity's profiling workflow.

      workflows, save game, and how these all came together in System Shock 3. Learn
      about the reason for wanting a stable instance Id, why Unity doesn't have one
      out of the box, what this implementation does, and how you can use it in your

    description: "Matth\xE4us Chajdas  (AMD) presents some of the new concepts behind
      D3D12 and how they affect games. D3D12 fundamentally changes the way graphics
      engines are designed and enables developers to achieve creative visions that
      were not possible before. Game-changing new features of D3D12 include multithreaded
      command list creation and asynchronous shaders. Command lists enable more efficient
      use of both the GPU & CPU and make it possible to render hundreds or thousands
      of different objects per frame. Similarily, asynchronous shaders allow to execute
      compute and graphics concurrently to max out the GPU usage. Learn how you should

      Copenhagen 2019
    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91zUwJwkXNQ
    channelName: Unity
    description: 'Battle Planet - Judgement Day is a unique game in the sense that
      it''s played entirely on a single sphere (the planet). Levels are fully procedural
      and fully destructible. This structure created a few big challenges in terms
      of rendering, which were solved by writing a custom Scriptable Render Pipeline
      for the game. This session provides an overview of the game''s rendering features
      and how they were implemented using SRP. It includes a few examples of how
      performance issues influenced the design of the pipeline as well as a discussion
      about shader programming and design patterns.

    description: 'Wooga is known for content-heavy, story-driven games that receive
      regular content and feature updates over many years (Pearl''s Peril, June''s
      Journey, Tropicats etc.). Creating games like these come with a unique set
      of problems and requirements to your game architecture and project setup. Updating,
      maintaining and adding features needs to be fast and simple while the project
      keeps on growing. To solve these problems, Wooga makes games modular and keeps
      projects lean, which allows the team to easily add, remove or A/B test features
      and enables fast iteration. You''ll see how clever scene management, project
      setup, lots of coroutines (or async code), some external tools (git, jenkins
      etc.) and Wooga''s internal package manager contribute.

  - title: A split screen-viable UI event system | Battle Planet Judgement Day -
      Unite Copenhagen
    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aR5UXatawmE
    channelName: Unity
    description: 'Hear about the implementation of a 2-player split screen user interface
      (UI) in Battle Planet Judgement Day. In Unity, the Event System allows only
      one element to be currently selected, which can be a problem when designing
      split screen UI. In this session, you''ll discover how this issue was addressed
      in Battle Planet Judgement Day, the ups and downs of the implementation, insights
      on pitfalls to avoid and best practices learned during the time of development.
      We hope this will help you learn how to implement your own solution.
