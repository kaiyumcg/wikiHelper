      the assets are crafted by hand, and then scanned into Unity with photogrammetry!
      \n\nDive into this nautic adventure as curiosity will guide you through a space
      ship wreck on an unknown planet made up of water. When one of the lead scientists
      still on board tries to unriddle the possibility of a relaunch young Janitor
      Harold is around to assist her. Join Harold in his clumsy undertakings to stir
      up the ark-like ship\u2019s stale day-to-day life and find the secrets that
      lie behind its doors.\n\nUnderwater atmosphere, self-reflective humor and contemporary
      adventure mechanics make up the foundation of this game created entirely out

    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91zUwJwkXNQ
    channelName: Unity
    description: 'Battle Planet - Judgement Day is a unique game in the sense that
      it''s played entirely on a single sphere (the planet). Levels are fully procedural
      and fully destructible. This structure created a few big challenges in terms
      of rendering, which were solved by writing a custom Scriptable Render Pipeline
      for the game. This session provides an overview of the game''s rendering features
      and how they were implemented using SRP. It includes a few examples of how
      performance issues influenced the design of the pipeline as well as a discussion
      about shader programming and design patterns.

      by step guide: https://on.unity.com/2zpHdXJ\n\nThe High Definition Render Pipeline
      (HDRP) is a high-fidelity Scriptable Render Pipeline built by Unity to target
      modern (Compute Shader compatible) platforms.\n\nIn this series of video, we're
      going to take a look at HDRP, and see how we can implement assets, upgrade
      materials, what features we can use, and more. \n\nThe HDRP utilizes Physically-Based
      Lighting techniques, linear lighting, HDR lighting and a configurable hybrid
      Tile/Cluster deferred/Forward lighting architecture and gives you the tools
      you need to create games, technical demos, animations and more to a high graphical
      standard."

    description: "Learn more about Serekh here: https://ole.unity.com/SerekhBlog\nYou
      can purchase Serekh from here: https://ole.unity.com/Serekh\n\nThe Unity Icon
      Collective strives to democratize high-end asset production. With Buried Memories,
      starting with Volume 1: Yggdrasil, we hope to inspire creators to extend their
      own universe but especially to guide aspiring artists and others to observe,
      analyze and learn from the techniques of industry veterans.\n\nVolume 2: Serekh
      is an asset pack geared toward an action-adventure game. It gives you the chance
      to experience being a humanoid creature with legendary strength and powerful
      technological weapons.\n\n\u201CThe package will be enjoyable for players passionate
      about the sci-fi genre and curious to try on the role of the monster beast
      troublemaker.\u201D \u2013 Edvige Faini, Concept Artist\n\nSerekh invites a
      discussion about humanity\u2019s vulnerability in the face of technology and
      science and the extent to which we can push boundaries through enhancement
      interventions, especially genetic manipulation. What does it mean to be human
      in the future?"
