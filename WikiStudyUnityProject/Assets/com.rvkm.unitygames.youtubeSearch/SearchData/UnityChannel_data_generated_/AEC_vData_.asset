    channelName: Unity
    description: 'This advanced presentation will focus on the exciting uses for
      high-resolution BIM data and provide an in-depth look at importing into Unity
      with a PiXYZ plugin for AEC (architecture, engineering, and construction) projects.
      We''ll demonstrate how the Revit format and Rule Engine will be performed by
      Unity while using PiXYZ to simplify the models for developers. We''ll be showing
      you previews of the upcoming photorealistic Unity material library specifically
      built for the AEC market.

    description: "Visualizing extremely large geospatial data sets presents several
      unique challenges -- how to efficiently index into a petabyte sized data set
      to load relevant data to the user, or manage framerate and memory usage when
      thousands of visual objects need to be created and destroyed each second. Explore
      how Fugro Roames overcame these challenges while developing Roames World, enabling
      the visualization of complex objects, viewing of real time information, and
