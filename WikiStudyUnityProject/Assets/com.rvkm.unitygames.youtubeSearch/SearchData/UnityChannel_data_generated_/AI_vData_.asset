    description: "Want to use the Danger Zone LEGO\xAE Microgame Add-On asset we
      used during the Jam? Get it for free here: https://on.unity.com/3kegXEa\n\nIn
      this live event, we will be taking you through the all new LEGO Microgame available
      on Unity and showing you some of the fun things you can do with it.\n\nWe will
      have special guests joining us from the Unity community and from LEGO to help
      guide you through this fun adventure.\n\nTo get the most out of this Game Jam,
      make sure to download all the assets required to participate alongside the
      live event.\n\nContinue the Learning Fun with our LEGO Live Learning Series
      here:\nhttps://on.unity.com/3m4fcLp\n\nHosts:\n\u2B50 Ashley Alicea, Unity

      Core Set Up\nSet up Unity and the LEGO Microgame on your computer\nhttps://on.unity.com/36qwHPp\n\nIf
      you have questions, reach out to us in the GameJam chat on Discord https://discord.com/invite/unity\n================================\n\nFAQs:\nQ:
      Do I need any Unity or programming experience to attend?\nA: Nope! This jam
      is for people who are new to Unity. We just ask that you arrive ready to jam
      (see above).\n\nQ: What are the system requirements to install Unity?\nA: https://on.unity.com/3fzPkUs\n\nQ:
      How long is the jam?\nA: We\u2019ll be jamming for about 2-2.5 hours. Of course,
      you\u2019re free to pop in and out. We\u2019ll do our best to make sure it\u2019s
      easy for people to just jump right back in with us!\n\nQ: Will it be recorded/published?\nA:
      Yes! The stream will be converted to a video once it ends, so you can review
      it at any time. If you missed it live, you can watch it at your convenience.\n\nQ:
      What is a game jam?\nA: This game jam is unique because it\u2019s hosted online,
      it\u2019s for beginners, we\u2019re using a game template, it\u2019s short,
      and we (pretty much) know what we\u2019re going to show you. A \u201Ctraditional\u201D
      game jam is an in-person event where you would typically gather with more experienced
      programmers, game designers, artists, etc. to create a game or project from
      scratch within a time span averaging 24\u201372 hours."

      and look at traditional C++ engine code and compiler output to compare with
      our approach. Gain a better understanding of how Unity is solving the problem
      of optimizing game code and the technology that we\u2019ve built to enable
      our solution.\n\nSpeaker:\nAndreas Fredriksson, Principal Engineer at Unity"

    channelName: Unity
    description: 'Artificial intelligence in games is back! An increasing number
      of games from AAA titles to small indies games are realizing that the advances
      in AI technology are opening up new opportunities for games to improve gameplay
      and launch entirely new genres of games. In this talk, Jakob Rasmussen (Apex
      Game Tools) shows cases emerging AI and bleeding-edge AI technologies as well
      as shows some of the emerging tools that bridge the chasm between the design-based
      technologies dominating the industry, and the new machine learning paradigm
      that still escapes most game products. In this context, we provide advice on
      how indie game developers can take advantage of the available technologies
      to overcome some of the barriers that are particular to indie game development.

    description: 'Watch this video in context on Unity''s learning pages here: http://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/modules/beginner/navigation/navmesh-obstacles

      Navmesh
      obstacles provide a dynamic way to block agent pathfinding on a navmesh. These
      items are not baked into the navmesh, and thus can move around freely while
      getting in the way. In this video we will learn about the navmesh obstacle
      component and how to apply it to objects in a scene.

      material-creation workflows to help create ultra-realistic worlds \u2013 the
      first tool to use this approach! It removes the burden of minutiae material
      creation work such as photoconversion to PBR materials, up-resing, deblur,
      seam removal, unwarping, color matching, and much more, helping artists focus
      on value-adding parts of the creative workflow.\n\nFind out more on the Unity
