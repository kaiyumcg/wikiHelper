      and experiment, and learn how to use the new features, including how to work
      with layered materials, post-processing, and light modes for the HD Render
      Pipeline (HDRP).\n\nThe FPS Sample is intended as a source of inspiration and
      learning for intermediate and experienced developers using Unity 2018.3 or
      Unity 2018.4 LTS releases. It\u2019s using experimental tech. Please note that
      the project is not supported and we highly recommend upgrading to latest packages
      if you wish to use parts of the project as a starting point for your own.\n\nThe

  - title: Custom SRP and graphics workflows | Battle Planet - Judgement Day - Unite
      Copenhagen 2019
    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91zUwJwkXNQ
    channelName: Unity
    description: 'Battle Planet - Judgement Day is a unique game in the sense that
      it''s played entirely on a single sphere (the planet). Levels are fully procedural
      and fully destructible. This structure created a few big challenges in terms
      of rendering, which were solved by writing a custom Scriptable Render Pipeline
      for the game. This session provides an overview of the game''s rendering features
      and how they were implemented using SRP. It includes a few examples of how
      performance issues influenced the design of the pipeline as well as a discussion
      about shader programming and design patterns.

    description: "When using the High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) we can use
      a custom pass to change materials on scene geometry, change the draw order
      in which objects being are rendered, and read camera buffers to use in our
      shaders. In this video, we'll take a look at how we can build a Custom Pass
