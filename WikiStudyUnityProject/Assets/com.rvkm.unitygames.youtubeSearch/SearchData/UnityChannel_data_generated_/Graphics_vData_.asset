    channelName: Unity
    description: "In Unity 2019, we introduced a few changes to the Lightweight Render
      Pipeline, including a name change! It is now called the Universal Render Pipeline
      - but what exactly is it? How do you use the URP? Well let's check it out!\n\nThe
      Universal Render Pipeline (URP) is a prebuilt Scriptable Render Pipeline, made
      by Unity. The technology offers graphics that are scalable to mobile platforms,
      and you can also use it for higher-end consoles and PCs. You\u2019re able to
      achieve quick rendering at a high quality without needing compute shader technology.
      URP uses simplified, physically based Lighting and Materials.\n\nLinks from

    description: 'Hear all about the VRefugees project, born out of the desire to
      create empathy for the journey of a refugee going from Syria to Germany. The
      project lead, Lina Zdruli, is an expert is using business for social good and
      creating intercultural understanding through technology interactions. The VRefugees
      team chose VR as a means of immersing the user in realistic, 3D narration to
      eliminate the sense of detachment sometimes felt when watching humanitarian-themed
      documentaries. The user experiences the journey as if they were the refugee
      themselves to increase empathy and eliminate detachment, a common theme in
      some of the 360* videos made of refugee camps or rescuers assisting people
      off the boats landing in Greece.

    description: 'Being able to create 3D models and surfaces on the fly is a powerful
      part of the Unity API that is often overlooked. These techniques are especially
      useful for games and apps using procedural content but it can also be used
      to create more powerful tools for making hand crafted experiences. In this
      talk Alexander Birke (Out Of Bounds Games) describes: 1. The basics of how
      Unity''s mesh API works 2. Practical examples of games where he has used procedural
      meshes to achieve novel gameplay and aesthetics such as a 1 draw call 2D deferred
      lighting system, morphable physics colliders, improved line rendering and polygonal
      procedural levels. 3. Common strategies to assign triangle indices, the most
      tricky part of the process 4. General tips on achieving better performance
      with the mesh API for both dynamic and static meshes'

    description: 'Be good, be true, find the right market: Making a successful mobile
      game based on an existing brand. When starting the development of The Walking
      Dead: No Man''s Land, the team decided to not only reflect the television IP''s
      look and feel in the game, but also model the brand in terms of game mechanics.
      The intent of the team was to provide the players with tough choices, as if
      you were living in a world infested with walkers. This resulted in the team
      marrying turn based combat mechanics married with rich character development
      system, simplified to be accessible as a mobile game. In this talk Joonas Laakso
      (Next Games) explores the choices made by the team, resulting in the game climbing
      to #1 download position in US App Store. The audience gains insight into approaching
      IP based games from game design perspective, where the game intends to reflect
      the essence of the brand through the overall player experience.

      a $5 asset and spending 30 minutes fixing makes way more sense than spending

      game map that players can explore as they defeat walkers and compete with other
      players. The solution? Stream the entire game to the user via Asset Bundles
      on low end mobile devices. In a given frame, thousands of static meshes are
      drawn along with hundreds of dynamic NPCs, with a dynamic day night cycle,
      shadows, and multiple light sources. In this talk, Disruptor Beam discusses

  - title: Unite Austin 2017 - How To Scale CPU Systems Dynamically
    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mol-WPnstY
    channelName: Unity
    description: 'Low, medium, and high: Standard fare for GPU settings, but why
      not CPU? Today the power of the CPU on end uers'' machines can vary wildly.
      Typically, developers will define their CPU min-spec, implement the simulation
      and gameplay systems using that performance target, and call it a day. This
      leaves the many potentially available cores built-in to modern mainstream CPUs
      sitting idle on the sideline. In this talk, Intel shares which systems in Unity
      are CPU scalable. Learn how to easily determine the power of the CPU in your
      scripts when enabling and configuraing those systems. Giving your players the
      best experience possible on all levels of hardware is the ultimate goal, and
      now it''s easier than ever.

      part of the Unity API that is often overlooked. These techniques are especially
      useful for games and apps using procedural content but it can also be used
      to create more powerful tools for making hand crafted experiences. In this
      talk Alexander Birke (Out Of Bounds Games) describes: 1. The basics of how
      Unity''s mesh API works 2. Practical examples of games where he has used procedural
      meshes to achieve novel gameplay and aesthetics such as a 1 draw call 2D deferred
      lighting system, morphable physics colliders, improved line rendering and polygonal
      procedural levels. 3. Common strategies to assign triangle indices, the most
      tricky part of the process 4. General tips on achieving better performance
      with the mesh API for both dynamic and static meshes'

    description: 'Allegorithmic develops the new generation of 3D texturing software:
      Substance Painter, Substance Designer and Bitmap2Material. With most AAA game
      studios using these tools (and many indies), Substance has become the industry
      standard for creating next-generation PBR (Physically Based Rendering) assets.
      Indeed, Photoshop is becoming less and less relevant for game developers since
      the rise of PBR, which is native in Unity 5.


      In this session, we will
      talk about PBR (Physically Base Rendering) in Unity 5 and give a live demo
      of workflows to create PBR-ready textures.

    description: 'This first part of this session will introduce Mono.Cecil, what
      can be done with it and what can''t, and demonstrate its usage with examples
      tailored for Unity users. Mono.Cecil is a library to analyze and manipulate
      IL code and binaries. Anytime you feel limited by the compiler of your language
      of choice, you can post-process your binaries with Cecil and reshape them into
      what you want.

      The second half of this session will demonstrate advanced
      reflection techniques to go above and beyond the Inspector. What if you want
      to see all the properties of your objects, including those with get/set accessors?
      Or you want to inspect an object that isn''t a GameObject or Component?

    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnxjHWEg4ek
    channelName: Unity
    description: "Picture this: Your awesome game is close to shipping, and suddenly
      you realize that you haven't implemented the player inventory screen! The truth
      is you've avoided touching the UI in your game as much as possible because
      the framework you built/borrowed/licensed/stole is too painful to work with.
      Data binding is a nightmare or just doesn't exist, the layout system is so
      complicated that you just positioned everything at exact pixel offsets by hand,
      and for some unknown reason rendering and animating UI takes 60% of your frame
      time. This is a pretty common story in the game dev world, but UIForia is fixing
      it. UIForia is a fully-featured UI Engine for Unity that offers lightning-fast
      data binding, a sophisticated yet approachable layout engine, hot reloadable
      templates, composable styling, and a very low learning curve. This session
      from Unite Copenhagen shows how UIForia is helping Klang ship one of the most
      ambitious MMO games ever.\n\nSpeaker: Matt Weichselbaum \u2013 Klang Games\n\nSlides

    channelName: Unity
    description: "In this technical talk, Wessam describes the science behind the
      UIElements rendering system, built from the ground up for retained-mode UI.
      The system uses every CPU/GPU trick in the book to render thousands of different
      elements onscreen in a fraction of a millisecond, all on one thread. This powerful
      UI performance and optimization tool also supports complex features like clipping
      and vector graphics, even on low-end devices.\n\nSpeaker: Wessam Bahnassi \u2013

      SpriteShape
      is a sprite layout or world building tool that provides the ability to tile
      sprites along the path of a shape based on given angle ranges. Additionally
      the shape can be filled with a tiling texture.


      The main feature of
      the SpriteShape is the powerful combination of a bezier spline path with the
      ability to tile Sprites adaptively or continuously while automatically switching
      Sprites assigned to given angles.'

    channelName: Unity
    description: "Watch this video in context on the official Unity learn pages -\nhttp://www.unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/navigation/navmeshsurface-component\n\nIn
      this live training session we will learn how to work with Unity\u2019s Navigation
      tools at runtime. We will explore the publicly available Components for Runtime
      NavMesh Building and look at how we can use the provided components to create
      characters which can navigate dynamic environments and walk on arbitrarily
      rotated surfaces, including enemies that walk on walls. In this session we
      will learn how to bake NavMeshes using the NavMeshSurface and how to set up
      multiple agent types if needed."

    description: 'Anton Hand (Rust Ltd) on how to structure the work of a small independent
      game development studio: "You''ve got this grand vision, and you''re beginning
      to map out your game, and then it hits you. How on earth are you going to get
      all this done?


      In this talk, we''ll be covering how an informed pre-production
      comprising aesthetic direction, modelling style, asset management, lighting
      approach, and more are the difference between success and careening into a
      brick wall. We''ll talk to making the most of your human resources, unpack
      the difference between having specialists and generalists for line-asset production,
      when and how to use the Unity Asset Store best, and what design/production
      decisions are critical to lock-in up front. Lastly, we''ll briefly cover some
      multi-platform strategies, and the sorts of things to be aware of if eventually
      planning to scale down to mobile, or scale up to VR. Expect a rapid-fire pace,
      a fair bit of ranting, and the bluntness you might expect from a veteran 3d
      modeller who''s tired of seeing great projects go off the rails.


      We
      at RUST LTD. have over the years become experts in the art of the insane small-team
      rush-project. We''ve studied and iterated on our internal production processes,
      and consulted with teams spanning Indie Games, Archviz, VR, Art Installation
      and all steps in between. Completing a limited-resource project (and really,
      aren''t they all?) can be a challenging endeavour, and we''d like to share
      the process that we''ve developed with you."

      Unity Online User Group'
    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTzjz-vhQII
    channelName: Unity
    description: 'Learn more and try the preview build: https://ole.unity.com/newprefabs


      Improved
      workflow


      The new Prefab workflows, which are now available as previews,
      allow you to split up scenes and Prefabs on a granular level. This gives you
      greater flexibility, increases your productivity and enables you to work confidently
      without worrying about making time-consuming errors.


      The improvements
      are based on surveys with more than 150 enterprise customers, numerous interviews,
      several usability tests and two game jams. The long-term goal has been not
      only to implement support for nesting, but to rethink the core Prefab workflows
      so different team members can simultaneously edit Prefabs confidently and efficiently.




      Nesting


      Previously,
      users were forced to choose between creating large monolithic Prefabs, like
      buildings, or more granular ones, like pieces of furniture, but they couldn''t
      do both.


      Now with support for nested Prefabs, a large building can
      be made up of many smaller room Prefabs, which in turn can be made up of multiple
      pieces of furniture Prefabs, and so on.


      This makes it easier for teams
      of all sizes to:


      Split up Prefabs into multiple entities for greater
      efficiency

      Reuse any content, from small to large

      Work on different
      parts of content simultaneously

      Learn more

      Prefab Variants

      Flexible
      properties increase efficiency

      As a default, a Prefab Variant inherits
      the objects and properties of the Prefab it is a variant of, but at the same
      time, you have the possibility to override those properties. This is similar
      to the concept of inheritance in object-oriented programming.


      For example,
      if you had multiple door Prefabs, you could choose to make some of them a different
      color, while allowing the rest to inherit the existing Prefab color property.
      Any change made to the original door Prefab will affect the variants of it
      as well, except those properties which have been overridden.



      Prefab
      Mode

      Avoid time-consuming mistakes

      A cornerstone of the new workflows,
      Prefab Mode enables you to edit in isolation. While this means that you will
      have to approach Prefab editing in a slightly different way, you can feel secure
      that any errors made will not have negative consequences.'

      Unity Online User Group'

      Improved
      workflow


      The new Prefab workflows, which are now available as previews,
      allow you to split up scenes and Prefabs on a granular level. This gives you
      greater flexibility, increases your productivity and enables you to work confidently
      without worrying about making time-consuming errors.


      The improvements
      are based on surveys with more than 150 enterprise customers, numerous interviews,
      several usability tests and two game jams. The long-term goal has been not
      only to implement support for nesting, but to rethink the core Prefab workflows
      so different team members can simultaneously edit Prefabs confidently and efficiently.




      Nesting


      Previously,
      users were forced to choose between creating large monolithic Prefabs, like
      buildings, or more granular ones, like pieces of furniture, but they couldn''t
      do both.


      Now with support for nested Prefabs, a large building can
      be made up of many smaller room Prefabs, which in turn can be made up of multiple
      pieces of furniture Prefabs, and so on.


      This makes it easier for teams
      of all sizes to:


      Split up Prefabs into multiple entities for greater
      efficiency

      Reuse any content, from small to large

      Work on different
      parts of content simultaneously

      Learn more

      Prefab Variants

      Flexible
      properties increase efficiency

      As a default, a Prefab Variant inherits
      the objects and properties of the Prefab it is a variant of, but at the same
      time, you have the possibility to override those properties. This is similar
      to the concept of inheritance in object-oriented programming.


      For example,
      if you had multiple door Prefabs, you could choose to make some of them a different
      color, while allowing the rest to inherit the existing Prefab color property.
      Any change made to the original door Prefab will affect the variants of it
      as well, except those properties which have been overridden.



      Prefab
      Mode

      Avoid time-consuming mistakes

      A cornerstone of the new workflows,
      Prefab Mode enables you to edit in isolation. While this means that you will
      have to approach Prefab editing in a slightly different way, you can feel secure
      that any errors made will not have negative consequences.'

      Modern
      mobile devices have a built in accelerometer which allows them to know their
      orientation in 3D space. We can use the devices orientation to control objects
      in our games. In this video you will learn about the accelerometer and how
      to use it in a scene.

    channelName: Unity
    description: "At Unite Copenhagen, this session looked at what's involved in
      merging real-time 3D and PLM in manufacturing. Within the manufacturing industry,
      and especially in the automotive segment, product lifecycle management (PLM)
      is a critical foundation for customer workflows. Real-time 3D needs to use
      PLM systems as a source of geometry and metadata. In this session, you'll hear
      from an expert from Atos, a leader in digital transformation, how PLM and real-time
      3D are coming together to enable powerful and efficient new workflows. \n\nSpeakers:
      Winfried Schwan- Atos & Laurent Milon- PiXYZ Software \n\nSlides available

    description: "In this ProBuilder tutorial for beginners, we will learn how to
      create an FPS Level in Unity 2019.  \n\nLearn more about ProBuilder here: https://ole.unity.com/probuilderintro\n\nNow
      part of Unity, ProBuilder is a unique hybrid of 3D modeling and level design
      tools, optimized for building simple geometry but capable of detailed editing
      and UV unwrapping too.\n\nUse ProBuilder to quickly prototype structures, complex
      terrain features, vehicles and weapons, or to make custom collision geometry,
      trigger zones or nav meshes.\n\nProBuilder also takes advantage of Unity\u2019s
      seamless round-tripping capabilities with digital content-creation tools (like
      Maya), so you can further detail and polish models with your favorite tools."

      This
      session will serve as an hour long overview of scripting in Unity. We will
      go at a slow pace and answer any questions you might have about the fundamentals
      of programming. Topics we will be reviewing are variables, conditionals, loops,
      and functions. Note that this is a beginner training, so we will get through
      as much material as possible, but the focus will be on answering any questions
      you might have. For best results, view the materials on scripting here: http://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/modules/beginner/scripting
      before attending. This will help you have some basic understanding and questions
      prepared for when we are live.

  - title: 'Improved Prefab Workflows: Nested Prefabs, Prefab Mode and Prefab Variants'
    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibmdm_PoyMA
    channelName: Unity
    description: 'Try out the preview build now! https://ole.unity.com/newprefabs
      or get the latest beta here: https://unity3d.com/unity/beta



      Improved
      workflow


      The new Prefab workflows, which are now available as previews,
      allow you to split up scenes and Prefabs on a granular level. This gives you
      greater flexibility, increases your productivity and enables you to work confidently
      without worrying about making time-consuming errors.


      The improvements
      are based on surveys with more than 150 enterprise customers, numerous interviews,
      several usability tests and two game jams. The long-term goal has been not
      only to implement support for nesting, but to rethink the core Prefab workflows
      so different team members can simultaneously edit Prefabs confidently and efficiently.




      Nesting


      Previously,
      users were forced to choose between creating large monolithic Prefabs, like
      buildings, or more granular ones, like pieces of furniture, but they couldn''t
      do both.


      Now with support for nested Prefabs, a large building can
      be made up of many smaller room Prefabs, which in turn can be made up of multiple
      pieces of furniture Prefabs, and so on.


      This makes it easier for teams
      of all sizes to:


      Split up Prefabs into multiple entities for greater
      efficiency

      Reuse any content, from small to large

      Work on different
      parts of content simultaneously

      Learn more

      Prefab Variants

      Flexible
      properties increase efficiency

      As a default, a Prefab Variant inherits
      the objects and properties of the Prefab it is a variant of, but at the same
      time, you have the possibility to override those properties. This is similar
      to the concept of inheritance in object-oriented programming.


      For example,
      if you had multiple door Prefabs, you could choose to make some of them a different
      color, while allowing the rest to inherit the existing Prefab color property.
      Any change made to the original door Prefab will affect the variants of it
      as well, except those properties which have been overridden.



      Prefab
      Mode

      Avoid time-consuming mistakes

      A cornerstone of the new workflows,
      Prefab Mode enables you to edit in isolation. While this means that you will
      have to approach Prefab editing in a slightly different way, you can feel secure
      that any errors made will not have negative consequences.'

  - title: Improve memory usage with the Memory Profiler in Unity (tutorial)
    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9wB4Cvgz5g
    channelName: Unity
    description: 'Check out the Memory Profiler documentation here: https://ole.unity.com/memory-profiler

      Download
      the assets here: https://ole.unity.com/memprofiler_ab2


      Use the Memory
      Profiler package to identify potential areas in your Unity project (and the
      Unity Editor itself) where you can reduce memory usage. For example, use the
      Memory Profiler to capture, inspect, and compare memory snapshots.


      The
      Memory Profiler package has a window in the Editor with an overview of native
      and managed memory allocations and can help you detect memory leaks and fragmentation.


      The
      Memory Profiler package creates a unified solution allowing you to profile
      both small projects on mobile devices and big AAA projects on high-end machines.


      You
      can also import snapshots taken from the Bitbucket Profiler and use them within
      the Memory Profiler.'

  - title: Import Vector Graphics into Unity 2018.2! - SVG Support
    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAyd5wSPQrM
    channelName: Unity
    description: "You can check out more about Unity's SVG support here:\nhttp://bit.ly/unitysvg2d\n\nYou
      can download Unity Hub from here:\nhttps://blogs.unity3d.com/2018/01/24/streamline-your-workflow-introducing-unity-hub-beta/\n\nScalable
      Vector Graphics can offer efficiency gains in performance, and file size, when
      making games! Therefore, we are introducing an SVG file importer in Unity 2018.2.
      \n\nIn this video, we'll take a quick look at how we can start using SVG assets
      in our games, and how the feature works. \n\nThis feature lets you import Scalable
      Vector Graphics (SVG) directly into your projects. The SVG Importer allows
      you to create sprite assets with a very small file size that will retain their
      quality at any resolution.\n\nThe SVG importer supports the most common features
      of the SVG 1.1 specification, such as gradients, fills, clipping paths, dashed
      lines, and rounded corners. Vector graphics sprites imported in this manner
      are supported by the Unity 2D tools.\n\nOnce an SVG file is imported, the vector
      data is tessellated into triangles and a sprite is generated. This sprite can
      then be used by the 2D system. The source for the SVG Importer can be found
      in the Editor folder of the package.\n\nGet the SVG Importer as part of the
      Vector Graphics Preview package from the Package Manager."

      the assets are crafted by hand, and then scanned into Unity with photogrammetry!
      \n\nDive into this nautic adventure as curiosity will guide you through a space
      ship wreck on an unknown planet made up of water. When one of the lead scientists
      still on board tries to unriddle the possibility of a relaunch young Janitor
      Harold is around to assist her. Join Harold in his clumsy undertakings to stir
      up the ark-like ship\u2019s stale day-to-day life and find the secrets that
      lie behind its doors.\n\nUnderwater atmosphere, self-reflective humor and contemporary
      adventure mechanics make up the foundation of this game created entirely out

      We built a pure path tracing based algorithm on top of Radeon Rays for baking
      lightmaps in Unity. We are looking at 10x+ performance improvement over the
      CPU version. That extra power can either be spent on an unparalleled interactive
      workflow experience or much shorter end-to-end baking times. It will support
      all of the lighting features in Unity.

      Find
      out more about Sprite Shape: http://ole.unity.com/spriteshape


      SpriteShape
      is a sprite layout or world building tool that provides the ability to tile
      sprites along the path of a shape based on given angle ranges. Additionally
      the shape can be filled with a tiling texture.


      The main feature of
      the SpriteShape is the powerful combination of a bezier spline path with the
      ability to tile Sprites adaptively or continuously while automatically switching
      Sprites assigned to given angles.'

    description: "This video shows an example of the results you can get by creating
      assets with Unity photogrammetry workflow.\n\nThere are different lighting
      conditions in the demo, showing that  assets created using the workflow work
      correctly under various lighting condition thanks to the Unity de-lighting
      tools.\n\nThe video was captured on a PC at 2560x1440, however the demo targets
      1080p @ 30fps on PS4.\n\nThe demo was made with game production constraints
      in mind. \nThe assets, textures and materials are reused heavily. Texture sizes
      range from 1K to 2K and all meshes have LOD. The demo makes use of tessellation
      and parallax occlusion mapping for close objects.\nFoliage uses atlas textures.
      Materials rely on layering.\n\n\nMore information regarding photogrammetry

      show developers how to get the most out of Unity when developing under the
      unique challenges of mobile platforms. Advanced rendering effects based on
      local cubemaps is covered in more detail and a new way of rendering dynamic
      real-time shadows based on the use of static local cube textures is revealed.
      \nFurthermore, they introduce the new Physically-Based Standard Shader. When
      used together with the new Reflection Probes and Global Illumination System,
      it creates stunning visuals. To know more details, you can download the ARM

      SpriteShape
      is a sprite layout or world building tool that provides the ability to tile
      sprites along the path of a shape based on given angle ranges. Additionally
      the shape can be filled with a tiling texture.


      The main feature of
      the SpriteShape is the powerful combination of a bezier spline path with the
      ability to tile Sprites adaptively or continuously while automatically switching
      Sprites assigned to given angles.'

    description: 'Watch on the official Unity learn pages here -

      http://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/modules/beginner/5-pre-order-beta/duck-volume-audio-effect


      In
      this lesson we''ll look at Unity''s Duck Volume audio effect.  Duck Volume
      allows us to cause the volume of an audio signal to duck or get quieter based
      on the volume of that signal, or a different one. A common use of this effect
      is sidechain compression. We''ll look at how to set up Duck Volume including
      routing signals to control ducking with Send audio effects.

    description: "Matth\xE4us Chajdas  (AMD) presents some of the new concepts behind
      D3D12 and how they affect games. D3D12 fundamentally changes the way graphics
      engines are designed and enables developers to achieve creative visions that
      were not possible before. Game-changing new features of D3D12 include multithreaded
      command list creation and asynchronous shaders. Command lists enable more efficient
      use of both the GPU & CPU and make it possible to render hundreds or thousands
      of different objects per frame. Similarily, asynchronous shaders allow to execute
      compute and graphics concurrently to max out the GPU usage. Learn how you should

    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ39btQ0XlE
    channelName: Unity
    description: "UIElements is a new retained mode UI framework for Unity, available
      now as a public API for Unity 2019.1. In its current form, it\u2019s a tool
      that makes it easier for you to extend the Unity Editor. In-game support and
      visual authoring will come in future releases.\n\n\u27A1\uFE0FLearn more about
      UI Elements, and Download the Example Project here: \nhttps://ole.unity.com/uielementsdemo\n\nCheck
      out the blog post here:\nhttps://ole.unity.com/UIElements\n\nTraditionally,
      building custom Editor windows and inspectors in Unity meant using IMGUI, an
      immediate mode API. IMGUI makes it easy to start building user interfaces but
      fails to scale when you\u2019re building more complex applications. It\u2019s
      also difficult for the system to optimize rendering because the user can drastically
      change the structure of the UI at any time within the current frame. Lastly,
      all UI is declared in C# which means that any future tool for authoring UI
      visually would need to generate C# code, which is a complicated proposition.\n\nIn
      UIElements, as a retained mode API, the idea is that you build your UI hierarchy
      of objects and let the system render it for you. This way, the system can optimize
      what it draws, and when it draws, leading to better overall performance. This
      paradigm also lets you decouple your hierarchy and styling from functionality,
      which results in a better separation of concerns and more approachable UI authoring
      for both artists and programmers.unity"

      In
      this second session we will continue to learn how to program a text based adventure
      game in C# by adding items which can be examined, taken and used, along with
      a very simple inventory system. In this episode we will finish adding the capacity
      for players to change the state of the game based on using an item in the correct
      room using Action Responses by creating the ''Use'' Input Action.'

      technological weapons.\n\n\u201CThe package will be enjoyable for players passionate
      about the sci-fi genre and curious to try on the role of the monster beast
      troublemaker.\u201D \u2013 Edvige Faini, Concept Artist\n\nSerekh invites a
      discussion about humanity\u2019s vulnerability in the face of technology and
      science and the extent to which we can push boundaries through enhancement
      interventions, especially genetic manipulation. What does it mean to be human
      in the future?"

    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aExdxF4OKBo
    channelName: Unity
    description: "Learn more about the Terrain Tools package here in this blog post:
      https://ole.unity.com/TerrainToolsPackage\nThis is the Asset Pack we used for
      the sky in this video: https://ole.unity.com/TimeOfDay\n\nThe Terrain Tools
      package contains brand new sculpting tools and a collection of common-use utilities
      to help automate tedious tasks.\n\nExisting terrain sculpting tools have been
      improved with new controls for rotation, spacing and scatter. Strength, size
      and rotation parameters now have a jitter control to help you add natural variation
      to your brush strokes. We\u2019ve also added shortcut keys to streamline the
      terrain brush workflow, providing quick access to common brush controls without
      needing to fiddle with the Inspector window.\n\nSeveral new sculpting tools
      are available when using this package including bridge, clone, noise, terrace,
      and twist. There are also Erosion tools that modify your height map based on
      Hydraulic, Wind and Thermal erosion.\n\nThe last major addition included in
      this package is the Terrain Toolbox. Unity 2018.3 enabled users to paint across
      multiple terrain tiles. This new feature was awesome but needed some important
      tooling to help streamline the creation of large terrains requiring many tiles
      and manage existing scenes with multiple terrain tiles."

      http://www.unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/2d-game-creation/confined-follow-camera-cinemachine-2d


      In
      this live session we will explore worldbuilding in 2D using Tilemap and 2D
      Cinemachine. Tilemap makes it fast and easy to create and iterate level design
      cycles right in Unity, so artists and designers can rapidly prototype when
      building 2D game worlds. We will look at how you can paint levels using the
      new tile and brush tools which allow you to define rules for how tiles behave
      when placed, creating platforms with dynamic edges, animated tiles, random
      tiles, and more. Cinemachine, is a dynamic, procedural camera system which
      it easy to automate composition and tracking to enhance gameplay. Cinemachine
      is now available for 2D games. In this segment we will look at adding a 2D
      Cinemachine camera and how to confine it to the area of our background, while
      following the character.'
