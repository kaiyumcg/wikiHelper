  - title: 'WindUp Trailer: Animated short created with Unity'
    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JCQ9V2y85s
    channelName: Unity
    description: "Get a sneak peek of Unity's newest animated short, Windup. Windup
      highlights the fragile nature of life, love, and what it means to never give
      up. \n\nThis film is created in real-time in out-of-the-box Unity 2019.2, the
      animators used regular desktops that most CG artists have at home. The result
      was achieved, by setting strict rules about poly-count, as well as what features
      they could afford to use. Such as using pixel displacement instead of tessellation
      shader; using joints animation instead of animation caches. We can't wait to
      share the full video with you later this year!\n\nLearn more: https://on.unity.com/2Z2RMx1\n\nFor
      more information on the ways Unity can help you achieve your animation goals,
      head over to https://on.unity.com/2Y9nnwJ. \n\nDirected by: Yibing Jiang\nProducers:
      Aleksander Karshikoff, Silvia Rasheva\nExecutive Producer: Junbo Zhang"

      this session we will learn how to create an in-game video player which the
      player can interact with using first person shooter controls. The goals of
      this session are to learn how to use the VideoPlayer component and how to write
      scripts to control it. In this session we''ll learn how to create an animated
      playhead that visually displays our current playback point within the length
      of a VideoClip.'

      In
      this live training session we will explore how to create interactivity using
      visual scripting in PlayMaker. PlayMaker allows non-programmers to begin quickly
      creating interaction in their games using it''s graphical interface. In this
      episode we will set up animated transitions for our invisibility mechanic and
      detect input from the player.'
