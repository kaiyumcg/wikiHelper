    description: "Get a sneak peek of Unity's newest animated short, Windup. Windup
      highlights the fragile nature of life, love, and what it means to never give
      up. \n\nThis film is created in real-time in out-of-the-box Unity 2019.2, the
      animators used regular desktops that most CG artists have at home. The result
      was achieved, by setting strict rules about poly-count, as well as what features
      they could afford to use. Such as using pixel displacement instead of tessellation
      shader; using joints animation instead of animation caches. We can't wait to
      share the full video with you later this year!\n\nLearn more: https://on.unity.com/2Z2RMx1\n\nFor
      more information on the ways Unity can help you achieve your animation goals,

    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6YqTrwjpP0
    channelName: Unity
    description: "In Unity 2019, we introduced a few changes to the Lightweight Render
      Pipeline, including a name change! It is now called the Universal Render Pipeline
      - but what exactly is it? How do you use the URP? Well let's check it out!\n\nThe
      Universal Render Pipeline (URP) is a prebuilt Scriptable Render Pipeline, made
      by Unity. The technology offers graphics that are scalable to mobile platforms,
      and you can also use it for higher-end consoles and PCs. You\u2019re able to
      achieve quick rendering at a high quality without needing compute shader technology.
      URP uses simplified, physically based Lighting and Materials.\n\nLinks from
      the video:\n\nCheck out our blog post about Universal RP: https://ole.unity.com/URP\nDownload

      Unity
      Playground is Unity''s first project dedicated entirely to absolute beginners,
      educators and anyone looking for an initial introduction to game development
      in a more simplistic form.


      This 2D, physics-based project contains
      a collection of single-action Components which you can use as building blocks,
      and combine them to create any type of gameplay. Simplified Inspectors for
      both Playground scripts and built-in Components mean that new users will not
      feel overwhelmed by the number of options.


      In addition to all of this,
      the project comes with five example games to play and learn from.

      Use
      the Playground for teaching, learning, or just introducing yourself to the
      world of Unity with loads of colorful 2D art assets and some great environments
      to experiment with.

      In
      this assignment we''re going to go step by step through the process of upgrading
      the Nightmares project''s audio to take advantage of the new audio features
      in Unity 5. This assignment is in two parts: in the first part we''ll route
      our audio sources to Audio Mixer Groups, apply a Low Pass Filter to our music
      track and also a Duck Volume Effect to our music so that it gets quieter when
      our sound effects play.

    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v14PdlcJnnA
    channelName: Unity
    description: "Download the project here: https://ole.unity.com/timeline_signals_demo\n\nWe\u2019ve
      built Signals to establish a communication channel between Timeline and outside
      systems. But what does that mean? Why did we decide on this approach?\n\nLet\u2019s
      say that you are using Timeline to create a cutscene. When the cutscene ends,
      you want a new scene to be loaded and you want to enable a physics system.
      There are a couple of ways to implement this scenario:\n\nWhen your cutscene
      ends, use custom scripts to make your Timeline instance interact directly with
      a scene manager and your physics system.\nWhen your cutscene ends, create markers
      and signals to send a \u2018\u2019Cutscene finished\u2019\u2019 signal and
      have interested systems react to the signal.\nThe Timeline team went with the
      second approach because it keeps the emitter independent from the receiver.
      Keeping them independent adds a lot of flexibility, power, and reusability.
      To understand this more, let\u2019s see how the different pieces work together."

      The
      DrawDefaultInspector function allows us to easily recreate the default inspector
      for a script inside a custom inspector. This is very useful if we only want
      to add new items to the inspector for a script instead of changing the currently
      existing items. In this video you will learn how to use the DrawDefaultInspector
      function.

      SpriteShape
      is a sprite layout or world building tool that provides the ability to tile
      sprites along the path of a shape based on given angle ranges. Additionally
      the shape can be filled with a tiling texture.


      The main feature of
      the SpriteShape is the powerful combination of a bezier spline path with the
      ability to tile Sprites adaptively or continuously while automatically switching
      Sprites assigned to given angles.'

      In
      this live training we will learn the updated workflow for creating and populating
      scroll-lists at run time using the Scroll Rect interaction component. We will
      use this to create a simple two column shop where items can be bought and sold
      between two lists. A Scroll Rect can be used when content that takes up a lot
      of space needs to be displayed in a small area. The Scroll Rect provides functionality
      to scroll over this content.

      parts of version 1 of our controllers, which have been on the Asset Store for
      many years and have resulted in a solid code base. A no compromises approach
      was taken during development when determining how to implement a feature: opting
      to have an extremely polished asset instead of quickly rushing a particular
      feature out the door. \n\nA wide variety of shootable weapons such as a rocket
      launcher, sniper, and bow & arrow are included. The spring system is the heart
      of first person perspective adding bobs, shakes, and sways to the camera/items.
      The editor scripts allow you to create your character and items in seconds.
      The ability system comes with over 20 abilities or add your own functionality
      without having to change any of the included scripts. Up may not always be
      up with the adjustable dynamic gravity system. Full body awareness is supported.
      UFPS comes with more than 200 pages of documentation plus tutorial videos to
      help you easily get started on your project."

      the power of these tools,\" he says. \nWe're very proud of such an endorsement,
      and to any viewer who might be considering using Unity we say: heed the advice

      this live training session we will look at creating a multiple choice quiz
      game. We will create the core game loop - timer, score, win and lose states.
      We will also show code architecture best practices - keeping data and logic
      separate, and how to structure a game in a way that makes it easy to maintain
      and extend. We will look at some of the ways we can extend this in session
      two.

      In
      this live training session we will look at creating a multiple choice quiz
      game. We will create the core game loop - timer, score, win and lose states.
      We will also show code architecture best practices - keeping data and logic
      separate, and how to structure a game in a way that makes it easy to maintain
      and extend. We will look at some of the ways we can extend this in session
      two.

      Unity Online User Group'
    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTzjz-vhQII
    channelName: Unity
    description: 'Learn more and try the preview build: https://ole.unity.com/newprefabs


      Improved
      workflow


      The new Prefab workflows, which are now available as previews,
      allow you to split up scenes and Prefabs on a granular level. This gives you
      greater flexibility, increases your productivity and enables you to work confidently
      without worrying about making time-consuming errors.


      The improvements
      are based on surveys with more than 150 enterprise customers, numerous interviews,
      several usability tests and two game jams. The long-term goal has been not
      only to implement support for nesting, but to rethink the core Prefab workflows
      so different team members can simultaneously edit Prefabs confidently and efficiently.




      Nesting


      Previously,
      users were forced to choose between creating large monolithic Prefabs, like
      buildings, or more granular ones, like pieces of furniture, but they couldn''t
      do both.


      Now with support for nested Prefabs, a large building can
      be made up of many smaller room Prefabs, which in turn can be made up of multiple
      pieces of furniture Prefabs, and so on.


      This makes it easier for teams
      of all sizes to:


      Split up Prefabs into multiple entities for greater
      efficiency

      Reuse any content, from small to large

      Work on different
      parts of content simultaneously

      Learn more

      Prefab Variants

      Flexible
      properties increase efficiency

      As a default, a Prefab Variant inherits
      the objects and properties of the Prefab it is a variant of, but at the same
      time, you have the possibility to override those properties. This is similar
      to the concept of inheritance in object-oriented programming.


      For example,
      if you had multiple door Prefabs, you could choose to make some of them a different
      color, while allowing the rest to inherit the existing Prefab color property.
      Any change made to the original door Prefab will affect the variants of it
      as well, except those properties which have been overridden.



      Prefab
      Mode

      Avoid time-consuming mistakes

      A cornerstone of the new workflows,
      Prefab Mode enables you to edit in isolation. While this means that you will
      have to approach Prefab editing in a slightly different way, you can feel secure
      that any errors made will not have negative consequences.'

      color, while allowing the rest to inherit the existing Prefab color property.
      Any change made to the original door Prefab will affect the variants of it
      as well, except those properties which have been overridden.

      A cornerstone of the new workflows,
      Prefab Mode enables you to edit in isolation. While this means that you will
      have to approach Prefab editing in a slightly different way, you can feel secure
      that any errors made will not have negative consequences.'

  - title: 'New Prefab Workflows 1/4: 2D Level Design With Tilemap and Nested Prefabs'
    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFIAGVydVu4
    channelName: Unity
    description: 'Learn more and try the preview build: https://ole.unity.com/newprefabs


      Improved
      workflow


      The new Prefab workflows, which are now available as previews,
      allow you to split up scenes and Prefabs on a granular level. This gives you
      greater flexibility, increases your productivity and enables you to work confidently
      without worrying about making time-consuming errors.


      The improvements
      are based on surveys with more than 150 enterprise customers, numerous interviews,
      several usability tests and two game jams. The long-term goal has been not
      only to implement support for nesting, but to rethink the core Prefab workflows
      so different team members can simultaneously edit Prefabs confidently and efficiently.




      Nesting


      Previously,
      users were forced to choose between creating large monolithic Prefabs, like
      buildings, or more granular ones, like pieces of furniture, but they couldn''t
      do both.


      Now with support for nested Prefabs, a large building can
      be made up of many smaller room Prefabs, which in turn can be made up of multiple
      pieces of furniture Prefabs, and so on.


      This makes it easier for teams
      of all sizes to:


      Split up Prefabs into multiple entities for greater
      efficiency

      Reuse any content, from small to large

      Work on different
      parts of content simultaneously

      Learn more

      Prefab Variants

      Flexible
      properties increase efficiency

      As a default, a Prefab Variant inherits
      the objects and properties of the Prefab it is a variant of, but at the same
      time, you have the possibility to override those properties. This is similar
      to the concept of inheritance in object-oriented programming.


      For example,
      if you had multiple door Prefabs, you could choose to make some of them a different
      color, while allowing the rest to inherit the existing Prefab color property.
      Any change made to the original door Prefab will affect the variants of it
      as well, except those properties which have been overridden.

      Navmesh
      obstacles provide a dynamic way to block agent pathfinding on a navmesh. These
      items are not baked into the navmesh, and thus can move around freely while
      getting in the way. In this video we will learn about the navmesh obstacle
      component and how to apply it to objects in a scene.

      Navigation
      requires the use of a simplified geometrical plane, often called a navmesh.
      The navmesh enables characters to plot a path around the various complex items
      in a scene. In this video we will look at how to create a navmesh (often called
      "baking") using Unity''s Navigation view.

    description: "In this ProBuilder tutorial for beginners, we will learn how to
      create an FPS Level in Unity 2019.  \n\nLearn more about ProBuilder here: https://ole.unity.com/probuilderintro\n\nNow
      part of Unity, ProBuilder is a unique hybrid of 3D modeling and level design
      tools, optimized for building simple geometry but capable of detailed editing
      and UV unwrapping too.\n\nUse ProBuilder to quickly prototype structures, complex
      terrain features, vehicles and weapons, or to make custom collision geometry,
      trigger zones or nav meshes.\n\nProBuilder also takes advantage of Unity\u2019s
      seamless round-tripping capabilities with digital content-creation tools (like
      Maya), so you can further detail and polish models with your favorite tools."

      learn more about Unity, check out some of our available courses on our Learn
      website: https://ole.unity.com/unitycourses\n\nTo check out some other cool
      effects, feel free to also browse the Unity Asset Store: https://ole.unity.com/MeshEffects\n\nIf
      you prefer a written article version, you can find that here: https://ole.unity.com/sgvertexarticle\n\nIn
      this video, we will provide a method for creating an interactive vertex displacement
      effect using Unity's Shader Graph tool, together with the Lightweight Render
      Pipeline (LWRP). \n\nA Shader Graph enables you to build your shaders visually.
      Instead of hand writing code you create and connect nodes in a graph network.
      \n\nThe Lightweight Render Pipeline (LWRP) is a prebuilt Scriptable Render
      Pipeline, made by Unity. The technology offers graphics that are scalable to
      mobile platforms, and you can also use it for higher-end consoles and PCs.
      You\u2019re able to achieve quick rendering at a high quality without needing
      compute shader technology. LWRP uses simplified, physically based Lighting
      and Materials.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/na3a/"

    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHslFO0vlGg
    channelName: Unity
    description: "Polybrush is a fantastic tool for Unity, which you can use for
      level design, scattering prefabs, painting and sculpting meshes! In Unity 2019.2,
      Polybrush was added to the Package Manager, and introduced the Prefab Scatter
      mode! \n\nLearn more about Polybrush here: https://ole.unity.com/polybrush\n\nAssets
      used in this video:\nTime Of Day (Sky): https://ole.unity.com/TimeOfDaySky\nLow
      Poly Rocks and Plants: https://ole.unity.com/RocksAndPlants\nTerrain Textures
      Pack Free: https://ole.unity.com/TerrainTexturesFree\n\nPolybrush enables you
      to blend textures and colors, sculpt meshes, and scatter objects directly in
      the Unity Editor.\n\nCombined with ProBuilder, Polybrush gives you a complete
      in-editor level design solution. You can also take advantage of Unity\u2019s
      seamless round-tripping with digital content-creation tools (like Maya) so
      you can further polish models with your favorite tools."

      In
      this live training example we will look at a common need for many games: localizing
      text into other languages. We will create a LocalizationManager class that
      loads a file with localized text, and a component that can be attached to a
      text field in order to populate it with the localized text at runtime.  We
      will also look at loading and parsing JSON files, dictionaries and some data
      driven best practices.'

      You''ve
      probably seen the sample 2D assets, watched the infinite runner presentation,
      and played around with the 2D tools in Unity. That''s all well and good if
      you want to make side scrolling 2D games, but what about top-down 2D games?
      In this session we are going to look at making top-down style 2D games in Unity.
      We will examine the ways to build scenes, ways to control characters, and some
      of the more confusing elements of the top-down style (including things like
      attacking). "Stabbing" is the new "explosions". Tutor: Mike Geig

      If
      ever there was a title that says it all, this one is it. In this session, we
      will look at prototyping a game mechanic whereby the player can throw a teleporter
      and be transported to its location. We will look at a couple of ways of achieving
      this effect, and talk about the strengths and weaknesses of each. Also, there
      may be waffles. Tutor: Mike Geig

      Plugins
      allow us to access native code (either managed or unmanaged) within Unity.
      This gives us access to powerful hardware not available on all devices, such
      as trackpads, cameras, an Oculus Rift, etc. In this lesson, we will learn the
      fundamental skills required to write plugins. Note that some of the features
      used in this session require Unity Pro. This session is programming intensive.
      You have been warned. Tutor: Mike Geig

      tips and tricks that you may not have known about. Topics include how to: Visualizing
      in the scene view with editor extensions, modularizing assets, and using particles
      for performance gain. We are literally cramming as much stuff into an hour
      session as we can, so who knows how much we''ll cover! Let''s find out!

      Merry
      Fragmas everyone! Mike Geig returns with a festive live training session packed
      with wanton yuletide destruction! In this session we will be building a Networked
      Multiplayer First Person Shooter game. The content will range from beginner
      to intermediate as we look at scripting and features specific to multiplayer
      networking. As this is an updated version of the Merry Fragmas live training
      from last December, some concepts will move more quickly. Another notable change
      is that this year we will be using the new networking system built into Unity
      instead of Photon. Pack a lunch because we are going to complete this in a
      single session even if it means we go over our usual 1 hour limit. Let the
      slay bells ring!

    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-zDOJllPZ8
    channelName: Unity
    description: 'Watch this video in context on Unity''s learning pages here: http://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/modules/beginner/live-training-archive/object-pooling

      You
      may have made games in the past that created and destroyed a lot of items (such
      as bullets or enemies). What you may not have known is that the act of instantiating
      and destroying are inefficient and can slow your projects down. In this session,
      we will look at a new way of handling this. This way is called object pooling.
      Tune in to learn the concepts of object pulling as well as how to build a generic
      pooler object than can be used in all of your projects.

      Tutor: Mike
      Geig

      Jump
      to 4:07 to bypass intro and technical issues.

      Do you want to know how
      to keep your data between scenes? How about between executions of your game?
      During this session we will learn how to do both. We will look at things like
      DontDestroyOnLoad, PlayerPrefs, and data serialization. Note that this session
      is coding intensive. It is advisable that you understand datatypes and OOP
      concepts before attending. Tutor: Mike Geig

      With
      a title like that, do you really need a description? Everyone likes blowing
      stuff up and so that is exactly what we are going to do. In this session we
      will be playing around with physics. We will be using impact force, overlap
      spheres, and other shenanigans to rain down havoc on the denizens of our game
      world. Don''t forget to wear safety glasses. Tutor: Mike Geig

      With that in mind, we present the infinite runner in one hour challenge. During
      this session, we will prototype and build the foundations of an infinite runner.
      We will try to cover as much as possible in the time we have. This game will
      be a platformer / runner using Unity''s 2D tools. Come check it out! Tutor:

      Merry
      Fragmas everyone! During this live training series, we will be building a multiplayer
      First Person Shooter game. We will be focusing on the animation, physics, networking
      (with Photon), and other tricks that make FPS games what they are. Content
      will range from beginner to intermediate+ (depending on what you consider difficult).
      We will be looking at a lot of scripting and a few pro features (though you
      should still be able to complete the training without pro). I have no idea
      how many days this will span, so I am scheduling it for 3. Please note that
      I do not know how many days will be required to complete this series and what
      is scheduled is just a guess. With that being said, let us crush our foes with
      holiday spirit! -Tutor: Mike Geig

    description: 'Watch this video in context on Unity''s learning pages here - http://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/modules/beginner/live-training-archive/scripting-primer

      This
      session will serve as an hour long overview of scripting in Unity. We will
      go at a slow pace and answer any questions you might have about the fundamentals
      of programming. Topics we will be reviewing are variables, conditionals, loops,
      and functions. Note that this is a beginner training, so we will get through
      as much material as possible, but the focus will be on answering any questions
      you might have. For best results, view the materials on scripting here: http://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/modules/beginner/scripting
      before attending. This will help you have some basic understanding and questions
      prepared for when we are live.

      Putting
      It Together - Who doesn''t like a good action movie? The best part is always
      when the super human hero walks away from an explosion in slow motion. With
      that in mind, I decided to recreate this magical moment in Unity using assets
      from the Asset Store. In this session we will talk about scene composition,
      effects like slow-motion, and using canned assets to build rich media. Let''s
      be honest though, mostly this session is about having fun. Come join us while
      we (again) blow things up! Tutor: Mike Geig

    description: 'Watch this video in context on Unity''s learning pages here - http://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/modules/beginner/live-training-archive/scripting-primer-continued

      This
      session will serve as an hour long overview of scripting in Unity. We will
      go at a slow pace and answer any questions you might have about the fundamentals
      of programming. This is a continuation of the previous scripting primer. As
      such, we will pick up where we left off. Topics we will be reviewing are variables,
      conditionals, loops, and functions. Note that this is a beginner training,
      so we will get through as much material as possible, but the focus will be
      on answering any questions you might have. For best results, view the materials
      on scripting here: http://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/modules/beginner/scripting
      and the previous live session here: http://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/modules/beginner/live-training-archive/scripting-primer
      before attending. This will help you have some basic understanding and questions
      prepared for when we are live.

  - title: Introducing the FPS Sample game project for Unity
    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC7l8Q7Chs0
    channelName: Unity
    description: "We are happy to introduce our first sample game project, the FPS
      Sample. With this project we want to show you not just what you can do in Unity,
      but HOW you can do it. In this project, you can pick everything apart, tweak
      and experiment, and learn how to use the new features, including how to work
      with layered materials, post-processing, and light modes for the HD Render
      Pipeline (HDRP).\n\nThe FPS Sample is intended as a source of inspiration and
      learning for intermediate and experienced developers using Unity 2018.3 or
      Unity 2018.4 LTS releases. It\u2019s using experimental tech. Please note that
      the project is not supported and we highly recommend upgrading to latest packages
      if you wish to use parts of the project as a starting point for your own.\n\nThe
      FPS Sample is available today: https://unity.com/fps-sample"

  - title: "Incremental Garbage Collection in Unity 2019 \u2013 Overview"
    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fks2NArDc0
    channelName: Unity
    description: "Learn more about Incremental Garbage Collection: https://ole.unity.com/IncrementalGC\n\nCheck
      out Performance Tools on the Asset Store: https://ole.unity.com/performance-tools\n\nCheck
      out our webpage for courses: https://ole.unity.com/unitycourses\n\nThe C# language
      uses managed memory with automated garbage collection, meaning that it uses
      an automatic method of tracking objects in memory and releasing the memory
      of any object which is no longer needed (See our documentation for more info).
      \n\nThe benefit of this is that you generally don\u2019t need to manually keep
      track of releasing any memory which you don\u2019t need anymore because the
      garbage collector will automatically do that for you, which makes your work
      easier and also removes a big source of potential bugs. The downside is that
      the garbage collector takes some time to do its work, and this may happen in
      moments when you would rather not want to spend time on this.\n\nUnity uses
      the Boehm\u2013Demers\u2013Weiser garbage collector which is a stop-the-world
      garbage collector, meaning that whenever it needs to perform garbage collection,
      it will stop the running program, and only resume normal execution once it
      has finished all its work. This can cause delays in the execution of the program
      at somewhat arbitrary moments, which can take anywhere between less than 1
      and several 100 milliseconds, depending on how much memory the garbage collector
      needs to process and on the platform the program is running on. \n\nNow, obviously,
      for real-time applications like games, this can become quite a big issue, as
      it isn\u2019t possible to sustain a consistent frame rate as required for smooth
      animation if the program\u2019s execution can be arbitrarily suspended by the
      garbage collector. These interruptions are also known as GC spikes, as they
      will show as spikes in an otherwise smooth profiler frame time graph. Usually,
      developers try to work around this issue by writing their code to avoid creating
      \u201Cgarbage\u201D memory while running the game, so the garbage collector
      has less work to do \u2013 but this isn\u2019t always possible or easy.\n\nEnter
      Incremental Garbage Collection. With Incremental GC, we still use the same
      Boehm\u2013Demers\u2013Weiser GC, but we run it in an incremental mode, which
      allows it to split its work into multiple slices. So instead of having a single
      long interruption of your program\u2019s execution to allow the GC to do its
      work, you can have multiple, much shorter interruptions. While this will not
      make the GC faster overall, it can significantly reduce the problem of GC spikes
      breaking the smoothness of the animation by distributing the workload over
      multiple frames."

  - title: 'Improved Prefab Workflows: Nested Prefabs, Prefab Mode and Prefab Variants'
    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibmdm_PoyMA
    channelName: Unity
    description: 'Try out the preview build now! https://ole.unity.com/newprefabs
      or get the latest beta here: https://unity3d.com/unity/beta



      Improved
      workflow


      The new Prefab workflows, which are now available as previews,
      allow you to split up scenes and Prefabs on a granular level. This gives you
      greater flexibility, increases your productivity and enables you to work confidently
      without worrying about making time-consuming errors.


      The improvements
      are based on surveys with more than 150 enterprise customers, numerous interviews,
      several usability tests and two game jams. The long-term goal has been not
      only to implement support for nesting, but to rethink the core Prefab workflows
      so different team members can simultaneously edit Prefabs confidently and efficiently.




      Nesting


      Previously,
      users were forced to choose between creating large monolithic Prefabs, like
      buildings, or more granular ones, like pieces of furniture, but they couldn''t
      do both.


      Now with support for nested Prefabs, a large building can
      be made up of many smaller room Prefabs, which in turn can be made up of multiple
      pieces of furniture Prefabs, and so on.


      This makes it easier for teams
      of all sizes to:


      Split up Prefabs into multiple entities for greater
      efficiency

      Reuse any content, from small to large

      Work on different
      parts of content simultaneously

      Learn more

      Prefab Variants

      Flexible
      properties increase efficiency

      As a default, a Prefab Variant inherits
      the objects and properties of the Prefab it is a variant of, but at the same
      time, you have the possibility to override those properties. This is similar
      to the concept of inheritance in object-oriented programming.


      For example,
      if you had multiple door Prefabs, you could choose to make some of them a different
      color, while allowing the rest to inherit the existing Prefab color property.
      Any change made to the original door Prefab will affect the variants of it
      as well, except those properties which have been overridden.



      Prefab
      Mode

      Avoid time-consuming mistakes

      A cornerstone of the new workflows,
      Prefab Mode enables you to edit in isolation. While this means that you will
      have to approach Prefab editing in a slightly different way, you can feel secure

  - title: Improve memory usage with the Memory Profiler in Unity (tutorial)
    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9wB4Cvgz5g
    channelName: Unity
    description: 'Check out the Memory Profiler documentation here: https://ole.unity.com/memory-profiler

      Download
      the assets here: https://ole.unity.com/memprofiler_ab2


      Use the Memory
      Profiler package to identify potential areas in your Unity project (and the
      Unity Editor itself) where you can reduce memory usage. For example, use the
      Memory Profiler to capture, inspect, and compare memory snapshots.


      The
      Memory Profiler package has a window in the Editor with an overview of native
      and managed memory allocations and can help you detect memory leaks and fragmentation.


      The
      Memory Profiler package creates a unified solution allowing you to profile
      both small projects on mobile devices and big AAA projects on high-end machines.


      You
      can also import snapshots taken from the Bitbucket Profiler and use them within
      the Memory Profiler.'

  - title: Import Vector Graphics into Unity 2018.2! - SVG Support
    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAyd5wSPQrM
    channelName: Unity
    description: "You can check out more about Unity's SVG support here:\nhttp://bit.ly/unitysvg2d\n\nYou
      can download Unity Hub from here:\nhttps://blogs.unity3d.com/2018/01/24/streamline-your-workflow-introducing-unity-hub-beta/\n\nScalable
      Vector Graphics can offer efficiency gains in performance, and file size, when
      making games! Therefore, we are introducing an SVG file importer in Unity 2018.2.
      \n\nIn this video, we'll take a quick look at how we can start using SVG assets
      in our games, and how the feature works. \n\nThis feature lets you import Scalable
      Vector Graphics (SVG) directly into your projects. The SVG Importer allows
      you to create sprite assets with a very small file size that will retain their
      quality at any resolution.\n\nThe SVG importer supports the most common features
      of the SVG 1.1 specification, such as gradients, fills, clipping paths, dashed
      lines, and rounded corners. Vector graphics sprites imported in this manner
      are supported by the Unity 2D tools.\n\nOnce an SVG file is imported, the vector
      data is tessellated into triangles and a sprite is generated. This sprite can
      then be used by the 2D system. The source for the SVG Importer can be found
      in the Editor folder of the package.\n\nGet the SVG Importer as part of the
      Vector Graphics Preview package from the Package Manager."

      this video, we're taking a look at Harold Halibut, and interviewing the developers
      at Slow Bros. Harold Halibut is a handmade adventure game, in which all of
      the assets are crafted by hand, and then scanned into Unity with photogrammetry!
      \n\nDive into this nautic adventure as curiosity will guide you through a space
      ship wreck on an unknown planet made up of water. When one of the lead scientists
      still on board tries to unriddle the possibility of a relaunch young Janitor
      Harold is around to assist her. Join Harold in his clumsy undertakings to stir
      up the ark-like ship\u2019s stale day-to-day life and find the secrets that
      lie behind its doors.\n\nUnderwater atmosphere, self-reflective humor and contemporary
      adventure mechanics make up the foundation of this game created entirely out
      of craft supplies."

    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddnb968cuuY
    channelName: Unity
    description: Pre-alpha version of the GPU accelerated Progressive Lightmapper.
      We built a pure path tracing based algorithm on top of Radeon Rays for baking
      lightmaps in Unity. We are looking at 10x+ performance improvement over the
      CPU version. That extra power can either be spent on an unparalleled interactive
      workflow experience or much shorter end-to-end baking times. It will support
      all of the lighting features in Unity.

      Find
      out more about Sprite Shape: http://ole.unity.com/spriteshape


      SpriteShape
      is a sprite layout or world building tool that provides the ability to tile
      sprites along the path of a shape based on given angle ranges. Additionally
      the shape can be filled with a tiling texture.


      The main feature of
      the SpriteShape is the powerful combination of a bezier spline path with the
      ability to tile Sprites adaptively or continuously while automatically switching
      Sprites assigned to given angles.'

    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7R3xiy8HDY
    channelName: Unity
    description: "Check out UFPS 2 here: https://ole.unity.com/ufps2\n\nIn this series
      of 3 videos, we're going to take a look at an overview of UFPS 2, and see how
      we can use a wide set of options and features to add an FPS controller into
      our Unity projects.\n\nThe Ultimate First Person Shooter (UFPS) is your ultimate
      solution for creating ANY first person shooter game. It is a professional,
      deterministic character controller designed to include the smoothest first
      person controls and to excel in all areas: PC, mobile, console, AI, networking,
      and VR. \n\nUFPS version 2 was built from the ground up leveraging the best
      parts of version 1 of our controllers, which have been on the Asset Store for
      many years and have resulted in a solid code base. A no compromises approach
      was taken during development when determining how to implement a feature: opting
      to have an extremely polished asset instead of quickly rushing a particular
      feature out the door. \n\nA wide variety of shootable weapons such as a rocket
      launcher, sniper, and bow & arrow are included. The spring system is the heart
      of first person perspective adding bobs, shakes, and sways to the camera/items.
      The editor scripts allow you to create your character and items in seconds.
      The ability system comes with over 20 abilities or add your own functionality
      without having to change any of the included scripts. Up may not always be
      up with the adjustable dynamic gravity system. Full body awareness is supported.
      UFPS comes with more than 200 pages of documentation plus tutorial videos to
      help you easily get started on your project."

    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCeP_XUIB5U
    channelName: Unity
    description: "This video shows an example of the results you can get by creating
      assets with Unity photogrammetry workflow.\n\nThere are different lighting
      conditions in the demo, showing that  assets created using the workflow work
      correctly under various lighting condition thanks to the Unity de-lighting
      tools.\n\nThe video was captured on a PC at 2560x1440, however the demo targets
      1080p @ 30fps on PS4.\n\nThe demo was made with game production constraints
      in mind. \nThe assets, textures and materials are reused heavily. Texture sizes
      range from 1K to 2K and all meshes have LOD. The demo makes use of tessellation
      and parallax occlusion mapping for close objects.\nFoliage uses atlas textures.
      Materials rely on layering.\n\n\nMore information regarding photogrammetry
      workflow in Unity can be found here: https://unity3d.com/solutions/photogrammetry\nSiggraph

      (HDRP) is a high-fidelity Scriptable Render Pipeline built by Unity to target
      modern (Compute Shader compatible) platforms.\n\nIn this series of video, we're
      going to take a look at HDRP, and see how we can implement assets, upgrade
      materials, what features we can use, and more. \n\nThe HDRP utilizes Physically-Based
      Lighting techniques, linear lighting, HDR lighting and a configurable hybrid
      Tile/Cluster deferred/Forward lighting architecture and gives you the tools
      you need to create games, technical demos, animations and more to a high graphical

    channelName: Unity
    description: "Check out JetBrains Rider here: https://ole.unity.com/JetBrainsRider\n\nJetBrains
      Rider is a powerful IDE for developing Unity/C# games. Do you find yourself
      frequently switching between the Unity editor and your C# code? In Rider you\u2019ll
      get play-mode controls, a log viewer, the Unity explorer, and a test runner
      right at your fingertips while working with your game code! Rider runs on Windows,
      MacOS and Linux! \n\nRider lets you write error-proof code with 2500+ live
      code inspections, while also having an eye on possible performance pitfalls,
      like calling GetComponent/Find during Update or using string-based invocations.
      Over 1000 quick-fixes and 50+ global refactorings allow you to improve your
      code and keep it working with confidence. Shared settings allow to easily establish
      a common code style across your team. \n\nThe integrated debugger is second
      to none. Step through any external code as if it was yours - even Unity engine
      code! Use dependent breakpoints, hit counts, tracing points, breakpoint conditions
      and more to master complex execution scenarios and threading issues. \n\nAs
      all IDEs from JetBrains, Rider comes with superior code navigation, integrated
      version control including support for GIT LFS and Perforce, local history to
      never lose sketched work, and database tooling."

      SpriteShape
      is a sprite layout or world building tool that provides the ability to tile
      sprites along the path of a shape based on given angle ranges. Additionally
      the shape can be filled with a tiling texture.


      The main feature of
      the SpriteShape is the powerful combination of a bezier spline path with the
      ability to tile Sprites adaptively or continuously while automatically switching
      Sprites assigned to given angles.'

    description: 'Watch on the official Unity learn pages here -

      http://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/modules/beginner/5-pre-order-beta/duck-volume-audio-effect


      In
      this lesson we''ll look at Unity''s Duck Volume audio effect.  Duck Volume
      allows us to cause the volume of an audio signal to duck or get quieter based
      on the volume of that signal, or a different one. A common use of this effect
      is sidechain compression. We''ll look at how to set up Duck Volume including
      routing signals to control ducking with Send audio effects.

      find 3D assets. Unity Visual Search is powered by machine understanding and
      finds objects based on shape similarity - making it super simple to discover
      the assets you are looking for. Build basic or advanced prototypes and add
      infinite number of 3D assets, shapes and models to your scene. With Unity Visual
      Search, anything you can imagine can be immediately previewed and brought to
      life. Any assets you find on Unity Visual Search can be added to your scene
      instantly without the need to download them from the Asset Store or purchase
      them. This previewing ability can save you a lot of time, money and frustration! 
      You can filter results by number of polygons, number of materials and price.
      Unity Visual Search discovers content from Unity\u2019s Asset Store and more
      content providers will be added very soon!"

      by Rune Skovbo Johansen. The Locomotion System automatically blends keyframed
      or motion-captured walk and run cycles and then adjusts the movements of the
      bones in the legs to ensure that the feet step correctly on the ground. The
      system can adjust animations made for a specific speed and direction on a plain
      surface to any speed, any direction, and any curvature, on any surface, including
      arbitrary steps and slopes. The Locomotion System can be downloaded from http://unity3d.com/support/resources/example-projects/locomotion-ik

  - title: Customize the Unity Editor with UIElements!
    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ39btQ0XlE
    channelName: Unity
    description: "UIElements is a new retained mode UI framework for Unity, available
      now as a public API for Unity 2019.1. In its current form, it\u2019s a tool
      that makes it easier for you to extend the Unity Editor. In-game support and
      visual authoring will come in future releases.\n\n\u27A1\uFE0FLearn more about
      UI Elements, and Download the Example Project here: \nhttps://ole.unity.com/uielementsdemo\n\nCheck
      out the blog post here:\nhttps://ole.unity.com/UIElements\n\nTraditionally,
      building custom Editor windows and inspectors in Unity meant using IMGUI, an
      immediate mode API. IMGUI makes it easy to start building user interfaces but
      fails to scale when you\u2019re building more complex applications. It\u2019s
      also difficult for the system to optimize rendering because the user can drastically
      change the structure of the UI at any time within the current frame. Lastly,
      all UI is declared in C# which means that any future tool for authoring UI
      visually would need to generate C# code, which is a complicated proposition.\n\nIn
      UIElements, as a retained mode API, the idea is that you build your UI hierarchy
      of objects and let the system render it for you. This way, the system can optimize
      what it draws, and when it draws, leading to better overall performance. This
      paradigm also lets you decouple your hierarchy and styling from functionality,
      which results in a better separation of concerns and more approachable UI authoring
      for both artists and programmers.unity"

      the AR Foundation package to add high-level functionality for working with
      augmented reality. Unity 2018.1 includes built-in multi-platform support for
      AR. The AR Foundation package wraps this low-level API into a cohesive whole
      and enhances it with additional utilities, such as AR session lifecycle management
      and the creation of GameObjects to represent detected features in the environment.\n\nAR
      Foundation is a set of MonoBehaviours for dealing with devices that support
      following concepts:\n\n- Planar surface detection\n- Point clouds, also known
      as feature points\n- Reference points: an arbitrary position and orientation
      that the device tracks\n- Light estimation: estimates for average color temperature
      and \nbrightness in physical space.\n- World tracking: tracking the device's
      position and orientation in physical space."

      modern (Compute Shader compatible) platforms.\n\nIn this series of video, we're
      going to take a look at HDRP, and see how we can implement assets, upgrade
      materials, what features we can use, and more. \n\nThe HDRP utilizes Physically-Based
      Lighting techniques, linear lighting, HDR lighting and a configurable hybrid
      Tile/Cluster deferred/Forward lighting architecture and gives you the tools
      you need to create games, technical demos, animations and more to a high graphical

    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aExdxF4OKBo
    channelName: Unity
    description: "Learn more about the Terrain Tools package here in this blog post:
      https://ole.unity.com/TerrainToolsPackage\nThis is the Asset Pack we used for
      the sky in this video: https://ole.unity.com/TimeOfDay\n\nThe Terrain Tools
      package contains brand new sculpting tools and a collection of common-use utilities
      to help automate tedious tasks.\n\nExisting terrain sculpting tools have been
      improved with new controls for rotation, spacing and scatter. Strength, size
      and rotation parameters now have a jitter control to help you add natural variation
      to your brush strokes. We\u2019ve also added shortcut keys to streamline the
      terrain brush workflow, providing quick access to common brush controls without
      needing to fiddle with the Inspector window.\n\nSeveral new sculpting tools
      are available when using this package including bridge, clone, noise, terrace,
      and twist. There are also Erosion tools that modify your height map based on
      Hydraulic, Wind and Thermal erosion.\n\nThe last major addition included in
      this package is the Terrain Toolbox. Unity 2018.3 enabled users to paint across
      multiple terrain tiles. This new feature was awesome but needed some important
      tooling to help streamline the creation of large terrains requiring many tiles
      and manage existing scenes with multiple terrain tiles."

      AudioMixers
      allow us to control the signal flow of audio sources in a Unity project. Using
      an AudioMixer one can change volume levels, route signals into groups and process
      sounds with audio effects. In this lesson we''ll cover the basics of creating
      and configuring AudioMixers including assigning audio sources to groups, routing
      groups into one another and routing AudioMixers into other audio mixers.

  - title: 'Adding Weapons - Unity 2018: UFPS 2 Overview (2/3)'
    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHpzREXV4mE
    channelName: Unity
    description: "Check out UFPS 2 here: https://ole.unity.com/ufps2\n\nIn this series
      of 3 videos, we're going to take a look at an overview of UFPS 2, and see how
      we can use a wide set of options and features to add an FPS controller into
      our Unity projects.\n\nThe Ultimate First Person Shooter (UFPS) is your ultimate
      solution for creating ANY first person shooter game. It is a professional,
      deterministic character controller designed to include the smoothest first
      person controls and to excel in all areas: PC, mobile, console, AI, networking,
      and VR. \n\nUFPS version 2 was built from the ground up leveraging the best
      parts of version 1 of our controllers, which have been on the Asset Store for
      many years and have resulted in a solid code base. A no compromises approach
      was taken during development when determining how to implement a feature: opting
      to have an extremely polished asset instead of quickly rushing a particular
      feature out the door. \n\nA wide variety of shootable weapons such as a rocket
      launcher, sniper, and bow & arrow are included. The spring system is the heart
      of first person perspective adding bobs, shakes, and sways to the camera/items.
      The editor scripts allow you to create your character and items in seconds.
      The ability system comes with over 20 abilities or add your own functionality
      without having to change any of the included scripts. Up may not always be
      up with the adjustable dynamic gravity system. Full body awareness is supported.
      UFPS comes with more than 200 pages of documentation plus tutorial videos to
      help you easily get started on your project."

    channelName: Unity
    description: "You can check out more about Pixel Perfect here:\nhttp://bit.ly/2dpixelperfect\n\nIn
      this video, we are going to take a quick look at the 2D Pixel Perfect feature
      introduced with Unity 2018.2. Pixel Perfect allows you to utilize the Pixel
      Perfect Camera component to achieve sharper pixels for your 2D pixelated games!
      \n\nTry the Pixel Perfect Preview package to stay true to your pixel art vision.
      The Pixel Perfect Camera component will help you get perfect, crisp pixels
      \u2013 regardless of the screen size \u2013 by making all the calculations
      automatically for you.\n\nYour sprites will even benefit from the feature when
      they are in motion or rotating, always keeping a sharp pixelation, without
      having to add interpolation to smoothen the edges as illustrated below."

      http://www.unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/2d-game-creation/using-rule-tiles-tilemap


      In
      this live session we will explore worldbuilding in 2D using Tilemap and 2D
      Cinemachine. Tilemap makes it fast and easy to create and iterate level design
      cycles right in Unity, so artists and designers can rapidly prototype when
      building 2D game worlds. We will look at how you can paint levels using the
      new tile and brush tools which allow you to define rules for how tiles behave
      when placed, creating platforms with dynamic edges, animated tiles, random
      tiles, and more. Cinemachine, is a dynamic, procedural camera system which
      it easy to automate composition and tracking to enhance gameplay. Cinemachine
      is now available for 2D games. In this segment we will look at how to use Rule
      tiles from 2D Extras to design 2D levels.'

      In
      this live session we will explore worldbuilding in 2D using Tilemap and 2D
      Cinemachine. Tilemap makes it fast and easy to create and iterate level design
      cycles right in Unity, so artists and designers can rapidly prototype when
      building 2D game worlds. We will look at how you can paint levels using the
      new tile and brush tools which allow you to define rules for how tiles behave
      when placed, creating platforms with dynamic edges, animated tiles, random
      tiles, and more. Cinemachine, is a dynamic, procedural camera system which
      it easy to automate composition and tracking to enhance gameplay. Cinemachine
      is now available for 2D games. In this segment we will look at how to use Random
      and Animated tiles to add detail to our levels.'

      This
      2D Roguelike project guides you through creating a turn based, tile based game
      with procedurally generated levels. In the game you play as a lone man trying
      to find food and survive the waste land for as long as you can.


      This
