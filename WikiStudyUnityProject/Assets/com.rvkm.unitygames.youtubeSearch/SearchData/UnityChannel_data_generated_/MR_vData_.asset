    description: "The sister project of EditorVR (https://youtu.be/FzjxRi5J4XI),
      Carte Blanche is Unity Lab's research initiative on VR-in-VR authoring tools
      for non technical users. \n\nWe are looking at the future of virtual reality
      experience creation and to that end are exploring how creative minds like level
      designers and artists might approach the next generation of creation platforms.
      We are working on finding the best solutions for enabling non programmers to
      build virtual worlds inside VR, so we are designing and implementing a platform
      on top of Unity that will integrate with the rest of Unity services.\n\nThis
      is a *concept video* showing the kinds of tools and interactions we envision
      for putting creation tools in the hands of consumers and artists.  \n\nUnity
