  - title: "Incremental Garbage Collection in Unity 2019 \u2013 Overview"
    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fks2NArDc0
    channelName: Unity
    description: "Learn more about Incremental Garbage Collection: https://ole.unity.com/IncrementalGC\n\nCheck
      out Performance Tools on the Asset Store: https://ole.unity.com/performance-tools\n\nCheck
      out our webpage for courses: https://ole.unity.com/unitycourses\n\nThe C# language
      uses managed memory with automated garbage collection, meaning that it uses
      an automatic method of tracking objects in memory and releasing the memory
      of any object which is no longer needed (See our documentation for more info).
      \n\nThe benefit of this is that you generally don\u2019t need to manually keep
      track of releasing any memory which you don\u2019t need anymore because the
      garbage collector will automatically do that for you, which makes your work
      easier and also removes a big source of potential bugs. The downside is that
      the garbage collector takes some time to do its work, and this may happen in
      moments when you would rather not want to spend time on this.\n\nUnity uses
      the Boehm\u2013Demers\u2013Weiser garbage collector which is a stop-the-world
      garbage collector, meaning that whenever it needs to perform garbage collection,
      it will stop the running program, and only resume normal execution once it
      has finished all its work. This can cause delays in the execution of the program
      at somewhat arbitrary moments, which can take anywhere between less than 1
      and several 100 milliseconds, depending on how much memory the garbage collector
      needs to process and on the platform the program is running on. \n\nNow, obviously,
      for real-time applications like games, this can become quite a big issue, as
      it isn\u2019t possible to sustain a consistent frame rate as required for smooth
      animation if the program\u2019s execution can be arbitrarily suspended by the
      garbage collector. These interruptions are also known as GC spikes, as they
      will show as spikes in an otherwise smooth profiler frame time graph. Usually,
      developers try to work around this issue by writing their code to avoid creating
      \u201Cgarbage\u201D memory while running the game, so the garbage collector
      has less work to do \u2013 but this isn\u2019t always possible or easy.\n\nEnter
      Incremental Garbage Collection. With Incremental GC, we still use the same
      Boehm\u2013Demers\u2013Weiser GC, but we run it in an incremental mode, which
      allows it to split its work into multiple slices. So instead of having a single
      long interruption of your program\u2019s execution to allow the GC to do its
      work, you can have multiple, much shorter interruptions. While this will not
      make the GC faster overall, it can significantly reduce the problem of GC spikes
      breaking the smoothness of the animation by distributing the workload over
      multiple frames."

    description: "Check out JetBrains Rider here: https://ole.unity.com/JetBrainsRider\n\nJetBrains
      Rider is a powerful IDE for developing Unity/C# games. Do you find yourself
      frequently switching between the Unity editor and your C# code? In Rider you\u2019ll
      get play-mode controls, a log viewer, the Unity explorer, and a test runner
      right at your fingertips while working with your game code! Rider runs on Windows,
      MacOS and Linux! \n\nRider lets you write error-proof code with 2500+ live
      code inspections, while also having an eye on possible performance pitfalls,
      like calling GetComponent/Find during Update or using string-based invocations.
      Over 1000 quick-fixes and 50+ global refactorings allow you to improve your
      code and keep it working with confidence. Shared settings allow to easily establish
      a common code style across your team. \n\nThe integrated debugger is second
      to none. Step through any external code as if it was yours - even Unity engine
      code! Use dependent breakpoints, hit counts, tracing points, breakpoint conditions
      and more to master complex execution scenarios and threading issues. \n\nAs
      all IDEs from JetBrains, Rider comes with superior code navigation, integrated
      version control including support for GIT LFS and Perforce, local history to
      never lose sketched work, and database tooling."

      exposing them to script control. Parameters that have been exposed to script
      control can be set using the SetFloat function.

      an AudioMixer one can change volume levels, route signals into groups and process
      sounds with audio effects. In this lesson we''ll cover the basics of creating
      and configuring AudioMixers including assigning audio sources to groups, routing
      groups into one another and routing AudioMixers into other audio mixers.
