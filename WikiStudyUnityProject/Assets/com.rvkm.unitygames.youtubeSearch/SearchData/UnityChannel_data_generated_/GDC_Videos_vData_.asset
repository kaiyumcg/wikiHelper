      of pioneering studios
    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFJavp5aAZA
    channelName: Unity
    description: 'Niels Monshouwer (WeirdBeard) and Geertsje Postma (WEB.foundation)
      talk about the uprising culture of gaming in Africa. Considering all the challenges
      and the fast growth of mobile devices and infrastructure on a continent of
      1billion people with great cultures and rich traditions, innovative industries
      are ready to spawn. Leti Arts has pioneered since 2009 the gaming industry
      which has served as a motivation to spawn a lot more in the sub Saharan region.
      From their talk at GDC 2013 titled the Emerging Landscape of African Game development,
      they wish to share how the growth has been since 2013 especially with skillset
      and the various tools being used including UNITY on the continent and how the
      gaming culture had improved and showing promise of monetization. (http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1018024/The-Emerging-Landscape-of-African)
      Below was the description from our GDC 2013 Talk. They give an update on how
      it has improved and share how they as Leti Arts have innovated around their
      challenges. For African audiences, video games are only a new medium to play
      what has already existed for centuries before. A video game developer in Africa
      must be able to design across the cultural boundaries, and educate the player
      in using new interactive technologies. There has been tremendous growth in
      mobile technology and the number of mobile users, so mobile phones have become
      the most popular gaming platform. However, political issues have affected many
      communities on the continent, which has led to any media, such as newspapers,
      television, and radio, being sensitive about the content they release to the
      public. Video games are no exception to this rule, and thus game creators must
      be careful about the themes and ideas behind their games.
