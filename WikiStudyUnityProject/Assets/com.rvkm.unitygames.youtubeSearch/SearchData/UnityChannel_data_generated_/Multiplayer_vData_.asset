      Merry Fragmas everyone! Mike Geig
      is back and bringing the holiday fear! In this multi-day session we will be
      building a Networked Multiplayer First Person Shooter game from the ground
      up. The content will range from beginner to intermediate as we look at scripting
      and features specific to multiplayer networking. Even if you''ve watched the
      previous Merry Fragmas episodes, you''ll want to come back for these as we
      are revisiting previous topics and looking at new / alternate methods of implementing
      them. Additionally, we''ll explore more on the concept of a lobby, networked
      animations, gameplay logic, and UI / polish. Let the slay bells ring!'

      Merry
      Fragmas everyone! During this live training series, we will be building a multiplayer
      First Person Shooter game. We will be focusing on the animation, physics, networking
      (with Photon), and other tricks that make FPS games what they are. Content
      will range from beginner to intermediate+ (depending on what you consider difficult).
      We will be looking at a lot of scripting and a few pro features (though you
      should still be able to complete the training without pro). I have no idea
      how many days this will span, so I am scheduling it for 3. Please note that
      I do not know how many days will be required to complete this series and what
      is scheduled is just a guess. With that being said, let us crush our foes with
      holiday spirit! -Tutor: Mike Geig
