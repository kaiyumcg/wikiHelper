      Core Set Up\nSet up Unity and the LEGO Microgame on your computer\nhttps://on.unity.com/36qwHPp\n\nIf
      you have questions, reach out to us in the GameJam chat on Discord https://discord.com/invite/unity\n================================\n\nFAQs:\nQ:
      Do I need any Unity or programming experience to attend?\nA: Nope! This jam
      is for people who are new to Unity. We just ask that you arrive ready to jam
      (see above).\n\nQ: What are the system requirements to install Unity?\nA: https://on.unity.com/3fzPkUs\n\nQ:
      How long is the jam?\nA: We\u2019ll be jamming for about 2-2.5 hours. Of course,
      you\u2019re free to pop in and out. We\u2019ll do our best to make sure it\u2019s
      easy for people to just jump right back in with us!\n\nQ: Will it be recorded/published?\nA:
      Yes! The stream will be converted to a video once it ends, so you can review
      it at any time. If you missed it live, you can watch it at your convenience.\n\nQ:
      What is a game jam?\nA: This game jam is unique because it\u2019s hosted online,
      it\u2019s for beginners, we\u2019re using a game template, it\u2019s short,
      and we (pretty much) know what we\u2019re going to show you. A \u201Ctraditional\u201D
      game jam is an in-person event where you would typically gather with more experienced
      programmers, game designers, artists, etc. to create a game or project from
      scratch within a time span averaging 24\u201372 hours."

      Core Set Up\nSet up Unity and the FPS Microgame on your computer\nhttps://on.unity.com/2WmLir2\n\nIf
      you have questions, reach out to us in the FPS Creators Group: https://on.unity.com/3gZxM4c\n\n\n#

      Navigation Mesh \nhttps://on.unity.com/2OMusNZ\n\n================================\n\nFAQs:\nQ:
      Do I need any Unity or programming experience to attend?\nA: Nope! This jam
      is for people who are new to Unity. We just ask that you arrive ready to jam
      (see above).\n\nQ: What are the system requirements to install Unity?\nA: https://on.unity.com/3fzPkUs\n\nQ:
      How long is the jam?\nA: We\u2019ll be jamming for about 2.5\u20133 hours.
      Of course, you\u2019re free to pop in and out. We\u2019ll do our best to make
      sure it\u2019s easy for people to just jump right back in with us!\n\nQ: Will
      it be recorded/published?\nA: Yes! The stream will be converted to a video
      once it ends, so you can review it at any time. If you missed it live, you
      can watch it at your convenience.\n\nQ: What is a game jam?\nA: This game jam
      is unique because it\u2019s hosted online, it\u2019s for beginners, we\u2019re
      using a game template, it\u2019s short, and we (pretty much) know what we\u2019re
      going to show you. A \u201Ctraditional\u201D game jam is an in-person event
      where you would typically gather with more experienced programmers, game designers,
      artists, etc. to create a game or project from scratch within a time span averaging
      24\u201372 hours.\n\nQ: Who is hosting the jam?\nA: \nKristin Stock https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCHg9mt6Tu6f-WCF4gf5oyQ\nCode

      scratch in about 24-72 hours.\n\nQ: What if I have a question that's not answered

      animators used regular desktops that most CG artists have at home. The result
      was achieved, by setting strict rules about poly-count, as well as what features
      they could afford to use. Such as using pixel displacement instead of tessellation
      shader; using joints animation instead of animation caches. We can't wait to
      share the full video with you later this year!\n\nLearn more: https://on.unity.com/2Z2RMx1\n\nFor

  - title: Kart Racing Game with Machine Learning in Unity! (Tutorial)
    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0Vt7l3XrIU
    channelName: Unity
    description: 'A Kart Racing Game with Machine Learning Agents, or ML Agents in
      Unity - what does it look like? Let''s take a look!


      In this video we
      will learn how to implement Unity''s machine learning toolkit ML Agents into
      Unity''s own Kart Racing Game project. We''ll use reinforcement learning to
      train our AI agent to travel around the track autonomously by seeing with raycasts
      and steering to avoid obstacles.

      Pipeline, including a name change! It is now called the Universal Render Pipeline

      Universal Render Pipeline (URP) is a prebuilt Scriptable Render Pipeline, made
      by Unity. The technology offers graphics that are scalable to mobile platforms,
      and you can also use it for higher-end consoles and PCs. You\u2019re able to
      achieve quick rendering at a high quality without needing compute shader technology.
      URP uses simplified, physically based Lighting and Materials.\n\nLinks from

    channelName: Unity
    description: 'The Game Equation workshop is an activity to do with clients to
      come up with game ideas. It produces some robust ideas that are thoroughly
      thought through. But the process takes about a week. VICKY (Values, Interests,
      Crazy 8s, Keepers, Yes and) is a series of exercises you can go through in
      about an hour with a team of 5. It takes the concepts of the Game Equation
      workshop and turns it into a brief guided brainstorming session designed for
      progress and to avoid gridlock. This produces game ideas that are a bit higher
      level than a weeklong workshop, but it can put you on a great path. Learn how
      to use VICKY. In this video, you''ll gain an understanding of each step so
      that you can mold this workshop to your own needs.

    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Var8GA7LyPE
    channelName: Unity
    description: 'Wooga is known for content-heavy, story-driven games that receive
      regular content and feature updates over many years (Pearl''s Peril, June''s
      Journey, Tropicats etc.). Creating games like these come with a unique set
      of problems and requirements to your game architecture and project setup. Updating,
      maintaining and adding features needs to be fast and simple while the project
      keeps on growing. To solve these problems, Wooga makes games modular and keeps
      projects lean, which allows the team to easily add, remove or A/B test features
      and enables fast iteration. You''ll see how clever scene management, project
      setup, lots of coroutines (or async code), some external tools (git, jenkins
      etc.) and Wooga''s internal package manager contribute.

    description: 'This session from Unite Copenhagen, presented in partnership with
      Google Cloud, focuses on the advantages of using cloud services for running
      simulations and other machine-learning training-related jobs that call for
      huge workloads. Many companies that are involved in simulation push the compute
      workload onto their on-premise infrastructure but this requires tremendous
      resources. Heavy-duty cloud resources are a powerful, scalable and on-demand
      alternative. Cloud provides an a-la-carte solution where compute workloads
      are profiled and deployed into an optimal specialized hardware solution that
      is tailored for the workload. It also provides a unique opportunity for the
      most innovative companies to step up their game.

      ports game code to the C# Job System and speeds it up using Burst. Next, he
      explores what you can and can't do with Burst and discuss common pitfalls,
      such as unsupported C# constructs.\n\nSpeaker: Lee Hammerton \u2013 Unity\n\nSlides

    channelName: Unity
    description: "Picture this: Your awesome game is close to shipping, and suddenly
      you realize that you haven't implemented the player inventory screen! The truth
      is you've avoided touching the UI in your game as much as possible because
      the framework you built/borrowed/licensed/stole is too painful to work with.
      Data binding is a nightmare or just doesn't exist, the layout system is so
      complicated that you just positioned everything at exact pixel offsets by hand,
      and for some unknown reason rendering and animating UI takes 60% of your frame
      time. This is a pretty common story in the game dev world, but UIForia is fixing
      it. UIForia is a fully-featured UI Engine for Unity that offers lightning-fast
      data binding, a sophisticated yet approachable layout engine, hot reloadable
      templates, composable styling, and a very low learning curve. This session
      from Unite Copenhagen shows how UIForia is helping Klang ship one of the most

    channelName: Unity
    description: 'Battle Planet - Judgement Day is a unique game in the sense that
      it''s played entirely on a single sphere (the planet). Levels are fully procedural
      and fully destructible. This structure created a few big challenges in terms
      of rendering, which were solved by writing a custom Scriptable Render Pipeline
      for the game. This session provides an overview of the game''s rendering features
      and how they were implemented using SRP. It includes a few examples of how
      performance issues influenced the design of the pipeline as well as a discussion
      about shader programming and design patterns.

      graph instead of having to write code.\n\nYou can do things like:\n\n- Procedurally
      alter your surface appearance\n- Warp and animate UVs\n- Modify the look of
      your objects using familiar image adjustment operations\n- Change your object\u2019s
      surface based on information about it, such as its world location, normals,
      distance from camera, etc.\n- Quickly tweak a shader\u2019s visuals in the
      context of a scene using the Material Inspector.\n- Share node networks between
      multiple graphs and users by creating subgraphs"

    channelName: Unity
    description: "Hi! I\u2019m your host, Sykoo. Check out this video I made that
      highlights what we\u2019re gonna do at this event: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qry3CrR9UA\n\nCurious
      for even more details?\n\nHere\u2019s the low down. We (this includes you!)
      are gonna take a free ready-made kart racing game and personalize/customize
      it a bunch of different ways. At the end, we\u2019ll show you how you can put
      your game on the web and share it with anyone to play! Even if you\u2019ve
      never used Unity or are still very new to it, don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll
      guide you step-by-step! All you gotta do is come prepared (see below) and follow
      along. And if you get stuck, just ask for help in the live chat and we\u2019ll
      help you out.\n\nThe cool thing about this game jam is that you influence what
      we show you. Ok, we\u2019ll definitely show you some of our favorite things
      you can do, like how to build your own custom track, add speed pads and cool
      props, set up custom triggers, and add some simple animation. But we\u2019re
      excited to hear YOUR ideas of what you want to do with the Karting Micro-Game
      -- so we\u2019ll be looking in the live chat to see what ideas we can help
      bring to life. Oh, and did I mention we\u2019ll be giving away $50-$75 Unity
      Gear Store vouchers to some lucky attendees just for participating?!\n\nTWEET
      TO WIN A PRIZE!\nOnce we\u2019re live, all you need to do is tweet using the
      hashtag #yourfirstgamejam and tag @unity3d to let us know you\u2019re watching,
      and if you have a screenshot of your karting game share it!\n\nSHARE YOUR CREATION
      ON THE WEB https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/karting-challenge-share-your-game\n\nHOW
      TO PREPARE:\nWe are gonna jump pretty quickly into showing you how to personalize/customize
      the Karting Micro-Game, so come ready! See the \u201CCome prepared\u201D steps
      here: https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/join-your-first-game-jam-on-aug-27#5d5570ecedbc2a0025e24517\n\n\nIf
      you have questions leading up to the event, reach out to us in the Karting
      Creators Group: https://connect.unity.com/g/karting-creators\n\nFAQs:\nQ: Do
      I need any Unity or programming experience to attend?\nA: Nope! This jam is
      for people who are new to Unity. We just ask that you arrive ready to jam (see
      above).\n\nQ: What other system requirements are there to install Unity?\nA:
      unity3d.com/unity/system-requirements\n\nQ: How long is the jam?\nA: We\u2019ll
      be jamming for about 3 hours. Of course, you\u2019re free to pop in and out
      and we\u2019ll do our best to make sure it\u2019s easy for people to do so
      so that when you come back you can just jump right back in with us!\n\nQ: Will
      it be recorded/published?\nA: We will publish the recording unlisted. We\u2019ll
      post the link in the Karting Creators Group sometime after the jam. connect.unity.com/g/karting-creators\n\nQ:
      What is a game jam?\nA: This game jam is unique because it\u2019s hosted online,
      it\u2019s for beginners, we\u2019re using a game template, it\u2019s short,
      and we (pretty much) know what we\u2019re going to show you. A *traditional*
      game jam is an in-person event where you would typically gather with more experienced
      programmers, game designers, artists, etc. to create a game or project from
      scratch within a time span averaging 24-72 hours.\n\nQ: Who is hosting the
      jam?\nA: \nSykoo Sam https://www.youtube.com/user/SykooTV\nMix and Jam https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLyVUwlB_Hahir_VsKkGPIA\nKristin

    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CvSoo0hlWI
    channelName: Unity
    description: "Check out JetBrains Rider here: https://ole.unity.com/JetBrainsRider\n\nJetBrains
      Rider is a powerful IDE for developing Unity/C# games. Do you find yourself
      frequently switching between the Unity editor and your C# code? In Rider you\u2019ll
      get play-mode controls, a log viewer, the Unity explorer, and a test runner
      right at your fingertips while working with your game code! Rider runs on Windows,
      MacOS and Linux! \n\nRider lets you write error-proof code with 2500+ live
      code inspections, while also having an eye on possible performance pitfalls,
      like calling GetComponent/Find during Update or using string-based invocations.
      Over 1000 quick-fixes and 50+ global refactorings allow you to improve your
      code and keep it working with confidence. Shared settings allow to easily establish
      a common code style across your team. \n\nThe integrated debugger is second
      to none. Step through any external code as if it was yours - even Unity engine
      code! Use dependent breakpoints, hit counts, tracing points, breakpoint conditions
      and more to master complex execution scenarios and threading issues. \n\nAs
      all IDEs from JetBrains, Rider comes with superior code navigation, integrated
      version control including support for GIT LFS and Perforce, local history to
      never lose sketched work, and database tooling."

    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v14PdlcJnnA
    channelName: Unity
    description: "Download the project here: https://ole.unity.com/timeline_signals_demo\n\nWe\u2019ve
      built Signals to establish a communication channel between Timeline and outside
      systems. But what does that mean? Why did we decide on this approach?\n\nLet\u2019s
      say that you are using Timeline to create a cutscene. When the cutscene ends,
      you want a new scene to be loaded and you want to enable a physics system.
      There are a couple of ways to implement this scenario:\n\nWhen your cutscene
      ends, use custom scripts to make your Timeline instance interact directly with
      a scene manager and your physics system.\nWhen your cutscene ends, create markers
      and signals to send a \u2018\u2019Cutscene finished\u2019\u2019 signal and
      have interested systems react to the signal.\nThe Timeline team went with the
      second approach because it keeps the emitter independent from the receiver.
      Keeping them independent adds a lot of flexibility, power, and reusability.
      To understand this more, let\u2019s see how the different pieces work together."

  - title: Customize the Unity Editor with UIElements!
    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ39btQ0XlE
    channelName: Unity
    description: "UIElements is a new retained mode UI framework for Unity, available
      now as a public API for Unity 2019.1. In its current form, it\u2019s a tool
      that makes it easier for you to extend the Unity Editor. In-game support and
      visual authoring will come in future releases.\n\n\u27A1\uFE0FLearn more about
      UI Elements, and Download the Example Project here: \nhttps://ole.unity.com/uielementsdemo\n\nCheck
      out the blog post here:\nhttps://ole.unity.com/UIElements\n\nTraditionally,
      building custom Editor windows and inspectors in Unity meant using IMGUI, an
      immediate mode API. IMGUI makes it easy to start building user interfaces but
      fails to scale when you\u2019re building more complex applications. It\u2019s
      also difficult for the system to optimize rendering because the user can drastically
      change the structure of the UI at any time within the current frame. Lastly,
      all UI is declared in C# which means that any future tool for authoring UI
      visually would need to generate C# code, which is a complicated proposition.\n\nIn
      UIElements, as a retained mode API, the idea is that you build your UI hierarchy
      of objects and let the system render it for you. This way, the system can optimize
      what it draws, and when it draws, leading to better overall performance. This
      paradigm also lets you decouple your hierarchy and styling from functionality,
      which results in a better separation of concerns and more approachable UI authoring
      for both artists and programmers.unity"

    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aExdxF4OKBo
    channelName: Unity
    description: "Learn more about the Terrain Tools package here in this blog post:
      https://ole.unity.com/TerrainToolsPackage\nThis is the Asset Pack we used for
      the sky in this video: https://ole.unity.com/TimeOfDay\n\nThe Terrain Tools
      package contains brand new sculpting tools and a collection of common-use utilities
      to help automate tedious tasks.\n\nExisting terrain sculpting tools have been
      improved with new controls for rotation, spacing and scatter. Strength, size
      and rotation parameters now have a jitter control to help you add natural variation
      to your brush strokes. We\u2019ve also added shortcut keys to streamline the
      terrain brush workflow, providing quick access to common brush controls without
      needing to fiddle with the Inspector window.\n\nSeveral new sculpting tools
      are available when using this package including bridge, clone, noise, terrace,
      and twist. There are also Erosion tools that modify your height map based on
      Hydraulic, Wind and Thermal erosion.\n\nThe last major addition included in
      this package is the Terrain Toolbox. Unity 2018.3 enabled users to paint across
      multiple terrain tiles. This new feature was awesome but needed some important
      tooling to help streamline the creation of large terrains requiring many tiles
      and manage existing scenes with multiple terrain tiles."

      analyze and learn from the techniques of industry veterans.\n\nVolume 2: Serekh
      is an asset pack geared toward an action-adventure game. It gives you the chance
      to experience being a humanoid creature with legendary strength and powerful
      technological weapons.\n\n\u201CThe package will be enjoyable for players passionate
      about the sci-fi genre and curious to try on the role of the monster beast
      troublemaker.\u201D \u2013 Edvige Faini, Concept Artist\n\nSerekh invites a
      discussion about humanity\u2019s vulnerability in the face of technology and
      science and the extent to which we can push boundaries through enhancement
      interventions, especially genetic manipulation. What does it mean to be human
      in the future?"

      the AR Foundation package to add high-level functionality for working with
      augmented reality. Unity 2018.1 includes built-in multi-platform support for
      AR. The AR Foundation package wraps this low-level API into a cohesive whole
      and enhances it with additional utilities, such as AR session lifecycle management
      and the creation of GameObjects to represent detected features in the environment.\n\nAR
      Foundation is a set of MonoBehaviours for dealing with devices that support
      following concepts:\n\n- Planar surface detection\n- Point clouds, also known
      as feature points\n- Reference points: an arbitrary position and orientation
      that the device tracks\n- Light estimation: estimates for average color temperature
      and \nbrightness in physical space.\n- World tracking: tracking the device's
      position and orientation in physical space."

  - title: Improve memory usage with the Memory Profiler in Unity (tutorial)
    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9wB4Cvgz5g
    channelName: Unity
    description: 'Check out the Memory Profiler documentation here: https://ole.unity.com/memory-profiler

      Download
      the assets here: https://ole.unity.com/memprofiler_ab2


      Use the Memory
      Profiler package to identify potential areas in your Unity project (and the
      Unity Editor itself) where you can reduce memory usage. For example, use the
      Memory Profiler to capture, inspect, and compare memory snapshots.


      The
      Memory Profiler package has a window in the Editor with an overview of native
      and managed memory allocations and can help you detect memory leaks and fragmentation.


      The
      Memory Profiler package creates a unified solution allowing you to profile
      both small projects on mobile devices and big AAA projects on high-end machines.


      You
      can also import snapshots taken from the Bitbucket Profiler and use them within
      the Memory Profiler.'

  - title: "Incremental Garbage Collection in Unity 2019 \u2013 Overview"
    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fks2NArDc0
    channelName: Unity
    description: "Learn more about Incremental Garbage Collection: https://ole.unity.com/IncrementalGC\n\nCheck
      out Performance Tools on the Asset Store: https://ole.unity.com/performance-tools\n\nCheck
      out our webpage for courses: https://ole.unity.com/unitycourses\n\nThe C# language
      uses managed memory with automated garbage collection, meaning that it uses
      an automatic method of tracking objects in memory and releasing the memory
      of any object which is no longer needed (See our documentation for more info).
      \n\nThe benefit of this is that you generally don\u2019t need to manually keep
      track of releasing any memory which you don\u2019t need anymore because the
      garbage collector will automatically do that for you, which makes your work
      easier and also removes a big source of potential bugs. The downside is that
      the garbage collector takes some time to do its work, and this may happen in
      moments when you would rather not want to spend time on this.\n\nUnity uses
      the Boehm\u2013Demers\u2013Weiser garbage collector which is a stop-the-world
      garbage collector, meaning that whenever it needs to perform garbage collection,
      it will stop the running program, and only resume normal execution once it
      has finished all its work. This can cause delays in the execution of the program
      at somewhat arbitrary moments, which can take anywhere between less than 1
      and several 100 milliseconds, depending on how much memory the garbage collector
      needs to process and on the platform the program is running on. \n\nNow, obviously,
      for real-time applications like games, this can become quite a big issue, as
      it isn\u2019t possible to sustain a consistent frame rate as required for smooth
      animation if the program\u2019s execution can be arbitrarily suspended by the
      garbage collector. These interruptions are also known as GC spikes, as they
      will show as spikes in an otherwise smooth profiler frame time graph. Usually,
      developers try to work around this issue by writing their code to avoid creating
      \u201Cgarbage\u201D memory while running the game, so the garbage collector
      has less work to do \u2013 but this isn\u2019t always possible or easy.\n\nEnter
      Incremental Garbage Collection. With Incremental GC, we still use the same
      Boehm\u2013Demers\u2013Weiser GC, but we run it in an incremental mode, which
      allows it to split its work into multiple slices. So instead of having a single
      long interruption of your program\u2019s execution to allow the GC to do its
      work, you can have multiple, much shorter interruptions. While this will not
      make the GC faster overall, it can significantly reduce the problem of GC spikes
      breaking the smoothness of the animation by distributing the workload over
      multiple frames."

      has collaborated with NVIDIA and the BMW Group to showcase the 2019 BMW 8 Series
      Coupe. Once thought impossible to achieve, performant real-time ray tracing
      delivers photorealistic image quality and lighting for any task where visual
      fidelity is essential, such as for design, engineering, or marketing, at a
      fraction of the time of offline rendering solutions.


      Real or rendered?
      Can you tell the difference between the real-time car and the physical car?

  - title: Making a Vertex Displacement Shader in Unity 2018.3! | Shader Graph
    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vh85pzT959M
    channelName: Unity
    description: "Download the demo project here: https://ole.unity.com/sgvertex\n\nTo
      learn more about Unity, check out some of our available courses on our Learn
      website: https://ole.unity.com/unitycourses\n\nTo check out some other cool
      effects, feel free to also browse the Unity Asset Store: https://ole.unity.com/MeshEffects\n\nIf
      you prefer a written article version, you can find that here: https://ole.unity.com/sgvertexarticle\n\nIn
      this video, we will provide a method for creating an interactive vertex displacement
      effect using Unity's Shader Graph tool, together with the Lightweight Render
      Pipeline (LWRP). \n\nA Shader Graph enables you to build your shaders visually.
      Instead of hand writing code you create and connect nodes in a graph network.
      \n\nThe Lightweight Render Pipeline (LWRP) is a prebuilt Scriptable Render
      Pipeline, made by Unity. The technology offers graphics that are scalable to
      mobile platforms, and you can also use it for higher-end consoles and PCs.
      You\u2019re able to achieve quick rendering at a high quality without needing
      compute shader technology. LWRP uses simplified, physically based Lighting
      and Materials.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/na3a/"

      Unity
      Playground is Unity''s first project dedicated entirely to absolute beginners,
      educators and anyone looking for an initial introduction to game development
      in a more simplistic form.


      This 2D, physics-based project contains
      a collection of single-action Components which you can use as building blocks,
      and combine them to create any type of gameplay. Simplified Inspectors for
      both Playground scripts and built-in Components mean that new users will not
      feel overwhelmed by the number of options.


      In addition to all of this,
      the project comes with five example games to play and learn from.

      Use
      the Playground for teaching, learning, or just introducing yourself to the
      world of Unity with loads of colorful 2D art assets and some great environments
      to experiment with.

      intended as a source of inspiration and learning for intermediate and experienced
      developers using Unity 2018.3 or Unity 2018.4 LTS releases. It\u2019s using
      experimental tech. Please note that the project is not supported and we highly

      but HOW you can do it. In this project, you can pick everything apart, tweak
      and experiment, and learn how to use the new features, including how to work
      with layered materials, post-processing, and light modes for the HD Render
      Pipeline (HDRP).\n\nThe FPS Sample is intended as a source of inspiration and
      learning for intermediate and experienced developers using Unity 2018.3 or
      Unity 2018.4 LTS releases. It\u2019s using experimental tech. Please note that
      the project is not supported and we highly recommend upgrading to latest packages
      if you wish to use parts of the project as a starting point for your own.\n\nThe

    description: "Download Unity Visual Search by Resonai for free here: https://ole.unity.com/visualsearch\n\nEasily
      find 3D assets. Unity Visual Search is powered by machine understanding and
      finds objects based on shape similarity - making it super simple to discover
      the assets you are looking for. Build basic or advanced prototypes and add
      infinite number of 3D assets, shapes and models to your scene. With Unity Visual
      Search, anything you can imagine can be immediately previewed and brought to
      life. Any assets you find on Unity Visual Search can be added to your scene
      instantly without the need to download them from the Asset Store or purchase
      them. This previewing ability can save you a lot of time, money and frustration! 
      You can filter results by number of polygons, number of materials and price.
      Unity Visual Search discovers content from Unity\u2019s Asset Store and more
      content providers will be added very soon!"

    channelName: Unity
    description: "Check out UFPS 2 here: https://ole.unity.com/ufps2\n\nIn this series
      of 3 videos, we're going to take a look at an overview of UFPS 2, and see how
      we can use a wide set of options and features to add an FPS controller into
      our Unity projects.\n\nThe Ultimate First Person Shooter (UFPS) is your ultimate
      solution for creating ANY first person shooter game. It is a professional,
      deterministic character controller designed to include the smoothest first
      person controls and to excel in all areas: PC, mobile, console, AI, networking,
      and VR. \n\nUFPS version 2 was built from the ground up leveraging the best
      parts of version 1 of our controllers, which have been on the Asset Store for
      many years and have resulted in a solid code base. A no compromises approach
      was taken during development when determining how to implement a feature: opting
      to have an extremely polished asset instead of quickly rushing a particular
      feature out the door. \n\nA wide variety of shootable weapons such as a rocket
      launcher, sniper, and bow & arrow are included. The spring system is the heart
      of first person perspective adding bobs, shakes, and sways to the camera/items.
      The editor scripts allow you to create your character and items in seconds.
      The ability system comes with over 20 abilities or add your own functionality
      without having to change any of the included scripts. Up may not always be
      up with the adjustable dynamic gravity system. Full body awareness is supported.
      UFPS comes with more than 200 pages of documentation plus tutorial videos to
      help you easily get started on your project."

      SpriteShape
      is a sprite layout or world building tool that provides the ability to tile
      sprites along the path of a shape based on given angle ranges. Additionally
      the shape can be filled with a tiling texture.


      The main feature of
      the SpriteShape is the powerful combination of a bezier spline path with the
      ability to tile Sprites adaptively or continuously while automatically switching
      Sprites assigned to given angles.'

    channelName: Unity
    description: "Check out Harold Halibut here: https://unity.com/madewith/harold-halibut\n\nIn
      this video, we're taking a look at Harold Halibut, and interviewing the developers
      at Slow Bros. Harold Halibut is a handmade adventure game, in which all of
      the assets are crafted by hand, and then scanned into Unity with photogrammetry!
      \n\nDive into this nautic adventure as curiosity will guide you through a space
      ship wreck on an unknown planet made up of water. When one of the lead scientists
      still on board tries to unriddle the possibility of a relaunch young Janitor
      Harold is around to assist her. Join Harold in his clumsy undertakings to stir
      up the ark-like ship\u2019s stale day-to-day life and find the secrets that
      lie behind its doors.\n\nUnderwater atmosphere, self-reflective humor and contemporary
      adventure mechanics make up the foundation of this game created entirely out
      of craft supplies."

      The Nautilus Odyssey

    description: 'Elena Candil, Daniel Candil (THQ Nordic)

      Visual Vertical
      Slices. A powerful concept to sell a videogame that sets the mood, the visual
      feeling, the atmosphere and the tone of a project. It''s like a candy to the
      viewer, a powerful claim that sells the game. The Nautilus Odyssey - Visual
      Vertical Slice was done in Unity in only 1,5 month by a team of two 3D Artists,
      one Animator and one designer in their spare time. This talk covers creating
      a Virtual Vertical Slice that sells a concept, the narrative, the environmental
      storytelling, the production plan, the development of assets, the visual rhythm,
      the art direction... and of course the help and agility to prototype that Unity
      can bring in such a short amount of time for the artists.'

      You
      will be introduced to a novel, high-quality, real-time motion synthesizer --
      a new concept for character animation that allows precise specification of
      the character movement, constraints and goals, while still leaving full control
      of look and feel in animators'' hands.

    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAyd5wSPQrM
    channelName: Unity
    description: "You can check out more about Unity's SVG support here:\nhttp://bit.ly/unitysvg2d\n\nYou
      can download Unity Hub from here:\nhttps://blogs.unity3d.com/2018/01/24/streamline-your-workflow-introducing-unity-hub-beta/\n\nScalable
      Vector Graphics can offer efficiency gains in performance, and file size, when
      making games! Therefore, we are introducing an SVG file importer in Unity 2018.2.
      \n\nIn this video, we'll take a quick look at how we can start using SVG assets
      in our games, and how the feature works. \n\nThis feature lets you import Scalable
      Vector Graphics (SVG) directly into your projects. The SVG Importer allows
      you to create sprite assets with a very small file size that will retain their
      quality at any resolution.\n\nThe SVG importer supports the most common features
      of the SVG 1.1 specification, such as gradients, fills, clipping paths, dashed
      lines, and rounded corners. Vector graphics sprites imported in this manner
      are supported by the Unity 2D tools.\n\nOnce an SVG file is imported, the vector
      data is tessellated into triangles and a sprite is generated. This sprite can
      then be used by the 2D system. The source for the SVG Importer can be found
      in the Editor folder of the package.\n\nGet the SVG Importer as part of the
      Vector Graphics Preview package from the Package Manager."

      https://github.com/unitytechnologies/spaceshooterecs\n\nIf you've seen an Entity
      Component System (ECS) demo and thought, \"how did they do that?\" then this
      talk is for you. Unity's ECS (combined with the C# Job System and the Burst
      Compiler) provides an easy and safe way to unlock the power of modern CPUs.
      Come see first-hand how to implement the ECS and the C# Job System in a project.
      You'll leave with a better understanding of the concepts, terminology, application,
      and massive benefits of these new additions to Unity. \n\nSpeakers:\nMike Geig

      Improved
      workflow


      The new Prefab workflows, which are now available as previews,
      allow you to split up scenes and Prefabs on a granular level. This gives you
      greater flexibility, increases your productivity and enables you to work confidently
      without worrying about making time-consuming errors.


      The improvements
      are based on surveys with more than 150 enterprise customers, numerous interviews,
      several usability tests and two game jams. The long-term goal has been not
      only to implement support for nesting, but to rethink the core Prefab workflows
      so different team members can simultaneously edit Prefabs confidently and efficiently.




      Nesting


      Previously,
      users were forced to choose between creating large monolithic Prefabs, like
      buildings, or more granular ones, like pieces of furniture, but they couldn''t
      do both.


      Now with support for nested Prefabs, a large building can
      be made up of many smaller room Prefabs, which in turn can be made up of multiple
      pieces of furniture Prefabs, and so on.


      This makes it easier for teams
      of all sizes to:


      Split up Prefabs into multiple entities for greater
      efficiency

      Reuse any content, from small to large

      Work on different
      parts of content simultaneously

      Learn more

      Prefab Variants

      Flexible
      properties increase efficiency

      As a default, a Prefab Variant inherits
      the objects and properties of the Prefab it is a variant of, but at the same
      time, you have the possibility to override those properties. This is similar
      to the concept of inheritance in object-oriented programming.


      For example,
      if you had multiple door Prefabs, you could choose to make some of them a different
      color, while allowing the rest to inherit the existing Prefab color property.
      Any change made to the original door Prefab will affect the variants of it
      as well, except those properties which have been overridden.



      Prefab
      Mode

      Avoid time-consuming mistakes

      A cornerstone of the new workflows,
      Prefab Mode enables you to edit in isolation. While this means that you will
      have to approach Prefab editing in a slightly different way, you can feel secure
      that any errors made will not have negative consequences.'

  - title: 'Improved Prefab Workflows: Nested Prefabs, Prefab Mode and Prefab Variants'
    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibmdm_PoyMA
    channelName: Unity
    description: 'Try out the preview build now! https://ole.unity.com/newprefabs
      or get the latest beta here: https://unity3d.com/unity/beta



      Improved
      workflow


      The new Prefab workflows, which are now available as previews,
      allow you to split up scenes and Prefabs on a granular level. This gives you
      greater flexibility, increases your productivity and enables you to work confidently
      without worrying about making time-consuming errors.


      The improvements
      are based on surveys with more than 150 enterprise customers, numerous interviews,
      several usability tests and two game jams. The long-term goal has been not
      only to implement support for nesting, but to rethink the core Prefab workflows
      so different team members can simultaneously edit Prefabs confidently and efficiently.




      Nesting


      Previously,
      users were forced to choose between creating large monolithic Prefabs, like
      buildings, or more granular ones, like pieces of furniture, but they couldn''t
      do both.


      Now with support for nested Prefabs, a large building can
      be made up of many smaller room Prefabs, which in turn can be made up of multiple
      pieces of furniture Prefabs, and so on.


      This makes it easier for teams
      of all sizes to:


      Split up Prefabs into multiple entities for greater
      efficiency

      Reuse any content, from small to large

      Work on different
      parts of content simultaneously

      Learn more

      Prefab Variants

      Flexible
      properties increase efficiency

      As a default, a Prefab Variant inherits
      the objects and properties of the Prefab it is a variant of, but at the same
      time, you have the possibility to override those properties. This is similar
      to the concept of inheritance in object-oriented programming.


      For example,
      if you had multiple door Prefabs, you could choose to make some of them a different
      color, while allowing the rest to inherit the existing Prefab color property.
      Any change made to the original door Prefab will affect the variants of it
      as well, except those properties which have been overridden.



      Prefab
      Mode

      Avoid time-consuming mistakes

      A cornerstone of the new workflows,
      Prefab Mode enables you to edit in isolation. While this means that you will
      have to approach Prefab editing in a slightly different way, you can feel secure
      that any errors made will not have negative consequences.'

      In
      this live session with guest host Aurore Dimopoulos, we will explore the 2D
      Game Kit project from Unity Technologies. 2D Game Kit is designed to allow
      new users to explore working in Unity and making games without first learning
      how to code in a friendly drag and drop environment. The kit consists of a
      vertical slice of a 2D platformer game complete with art, sound and interactive
      behavior to explore.'

  - title: Sundance Film Festival panel - Real-time film production takes center
      stage (full)
    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uNCnChl9CU
    channelName: Unity
    description: "Unity invited the boldest storytellers, creators, and industry
      leaders to take part in an evening of discussions and networking centered around
      the power of real-time and how it\u2019s already revolutionizing the way that
      movies are created, from pre-visualization to virtual production. Special guests
      included Academy Award-winner Ben Grossman of Magnopus and Pixar\u2019s John
      Halstead, Technical Director for Coco, who discussed transferring film IP to
      VR. BAFTA winner Habib Zargapour and Wes Potter of Digital Monarch Media (Blade
      Runner 2049, Disney\u2019s The Jungle Book, and the upcoming film, Ready Player
      One) revealed how they use Unity for virtual production. Chris Harvey also
      demonstrated how the power of real-time brought the short films ADAM: The Mirror
      and ADAM: Episode 3 to life in a fraction of the time of a traditional production
      pipeline.\n\nhttps://unity3d.com/sff/18"

    description: Pre-alpha version of the GPU accelerated Progressive Lightmapper.
      We built a pure path tracing based algorithm on top of Radeon Rays for baking
      lightmaps in Unity. We are looking at 10x+ performance improvement over the
      CPU version. That extra power can either be spent on an unparalleled interactive
      workflow experience or much shorter end-to-end baking times. It will support
      all of the lighting features in Unity.

      In
      this live session we will explore worldbuilding in 2D using Tilemap and 2D
      Cinemachine. Tilemap makes it fast and easy to create and iterate level design
      cycles right in Unity, so artists and designers can rapidly prototype when
      building 2D game worlds. We will look at how you can paint levels using the
      new tile and brush tools which allow you to define rules for how tiles behave
      when placed, creating platforms with dynamic edges, animated tiles, random
      tiles, and more. Cinemachine, is a dynamic, procedural camera system which
      it easy to automate composition and tracking to enhance gameplay. Cinemachine
      is now available for 2D games. In this segment we will look at adding a 2D
      Cinemachine camera and how to confine it to the area of our background, while
      following the character.'

      http://www.unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/2d-game-creation/questions-and-answers-2d-worldbuilding


      In
      this live session we will explore worldbuilding in 2D using Tilemap and 2D
      Cinemachine. Tilemap makes it fast and easy to create and iterate level design
      cycles right in Unity, so artists and designers can rapidly prototype when
      building 2D game worlds. We will look at how you can paint levels using the
      new tile and brush tools which allow you to define rules for how tiles behave
      when placed, creating platforms with dynamic edges, animated tiles, random
      tiles, and more. Cinemachine, is a dynamic, procedural camera system which
      it easy to automate composition and tracking to enhance gameplay. Cinemachine
      is now available for 2D games. In this segment we will look take questions
      from the Twitch chat and provide answers.'

    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIf3-aDTOOA

    description: "S.O.L.I.D. is a collection of 5 programming principles that allow
      you to build larger applications, while keeping the code maintainable, flexible
      and, in general, with fewer bugs. The business world has enjoyed this in many
      languages for many years, but may seem impossible in Unity. Productive Edge
      explains what each of the five principles mean, along with examples, and most
      importantly, how to apply them in your own Unity coding. \n\nThis talk also
      covers two great features as part of S.O.L.I.D. First, the use of DLL's instead
      of Scripts (optional), which allow you to add Unit Tests via MSTest or NUnit.
      Normally, this is impossible because of Unity's object duality (.NET/C++) throwing
      errors outside of Unity, but this talk teaches you how to get around that.
      Second, how to implement a Dependency Injection system, similar to Ninject,
      but designed for Unity, without requiring the designers to understand DI programming.\n\nDan

    channelName: Unity
    description: 'Low, medium, and high: Standard fare for GPU settings, but why
      not CPU? Today the power of the CPU on end uers'' machines can vary wildly.
      Typically, developers will define their CPU min-spec, implement the simulation
      and gameplay systems using that performance target, and call it a day. This
      leaves the many potentially available cores built-in to modern mainstream CPUs
      sitting idle on the sideline. In this talk, Intel shares which systems in Unity
      are CPU scalable. Learn how to easily determine the power of the CPU in your
      scripts when enabling and configuraing those systems. Giving your players the
      best experience possible on all levels of hardware is the ultimate goal, and
      now it''s easier than ever.

      In
      this live training session with Mike Geig we take a look at how to create a
      2D platformer game using the assets from the 2D Essentials Pack including:
      Corgi Engine, DoozyUI, DOTween Pro, and 2DDL Pro. 2D Essentials is one of the
      free asset packs you can select when you subscribe to Unity Plus. In this episode
      we''ll use Cinemachine to create a camera that can follow our player with a
      dead zone, and without moving out of bounds that we define.'

      challenge for Disruptor Beam - how to create an extremely large and very dense
      game map that players can explore as they defeat walkers and compete with other
      players. The solution? Stream the entire game to the user via Asset Bundles
      on low end mobile devices. In a given frame, thousands of static meshes are
      drawn along with hundreds of dynamic NPCs, with a dynamic day night cycle,
      shadows, and multiple light sources. In this talk, Disruptor Beam discusses
      how they rendered over 10,000 objects for low-end mobile devices using Unity.

    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCeP_XUIB5U
    channelName: Unity
    description: "This video shows an example of the results you can get by creating
      assets with Unity photogrammetry workflow.\n\nThere are different lighting
      conditions in the demo, showing that  assets created using the workflow work
      correctly under various lighting condition thanks to the Unity de-lighting
      tools.\n\nThe video was captured on a PC at 2560x1440, however the demo targets
      1080p @ 30fps on PS4.\n\nThe demo was made with game production constraints
      in mind. \nThe assets, textures and materials are reused heavily. Texture sizes
      range from 1K to 2K and all meshes have LOD. The demo makes use of tessellation
      and parallax occlusion mapping for close objects.\nFoliage uses atlas textures.
      Materials rely on layering.\n\n\nMore information regarding photogrammetry

      this live training session we will learn how to work with Unity\u2019s Navigation
      tools at runtime. We will explore the publicly available Components for Runtime
      NavMesh Building and look at how we can use the provided components to create
      characters which can navigate dynamic environments and walk on arbitrarily
      rotated surfaces, including enemies that walk on walls. In this session we

    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rtpm_F9GXk
    channelName: Unity
    description: 'This talk presents a qualitative study with the purpose to evaluate
      users'' perceptions of an immersive virtual reality (IVR) scenario in which
      they evaluate the appearance and functionality of myoelectric prostheses. Seven
      people with transradial upper limb deficiency participated in the study that
      involved trying out a virtual kitchen environment using a Oculus rift headset.
      Each participant tested three virtual prosthetic models that could be controlled
      by a Myo armband placed around their stump. The IVR scenario was evaluated
      positively and enabled users to evaluate the appearance of the prosthesis designs
      and the grip function of a virtual myoelectric prosthesis. Users were all able
      to grasp, even if they had not previously been trained to use a myoelectric
      device. The system showed considerable promise for use as an affordable, portable,
      myoelectric prosthesis-training tool. The ecologically valid context of the
      training may both facilitate learning and make it more enjoyable and efficient.

      eliminate the sense of detachment sometimes felt when watching humanitarian-themed
      documentaries. The user experiences the journey as if they were the refugee
      themselves to increase empathy and eliminate detachment, a common theme in
      some of the 360* videos made of refugee camps or rescuers assisting people
      off the boats landing in Greece.

    description: "PlayStation\u2019s Magic Lab is a research group that looks to
      the future and explores a variety of innovative entertainment experiences through
      technology, including VR. We choose Unity for many of our prototypes, often
      using it in novel ways. For instance, support for PlayStation VR in Unity was
      born in Magic Lab so that we could explore different experiences and interactions
      in virtual worlds; from standing on the surface of Mars, to controlling a virtual
      humanoid robot on the International Space Station, to navigation techniques,
      and most recently to exploration of believable virtual characters. As we continue
      to expand our scope, we\u2019re looking to ways to bridge the gap between the
      virtual and real worlds. In some cases we move completely to the real world,
      with AI on a PlayStation flying drones to bring a real, physical side to play.\n\nSteven

    channelName: Unity
    description: 'Many companies have existing 3D assets and want to leverage those
      CAD/CAM, editorial and other 3D models also in interactive immersive scenarios.
      But rendering those complex models in real-time poses an interesting challenge
      with mobile VR/AR/MR development and devices like HoloLens which have limited
      computing power. How can those insanely large polygonal models be optimized
      to fit into the rendering budget of a mobile device? In this session Rene Schulte
      will answer that question and provides best practices. He and his team is working
      with the HoloLens since 2015 with many clients that faced similar challenges.
      Rene distilled 3 key approaches and will demonstrate them also with Mixed Reality
      live demos on-stage.

      into VR'
    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwbucE_Yoe8
    channelName: Unity
    description: "The recently introduced Vive Tracker -- which enables motion tracking
      of objects in VR -- has already inspired a diverse range of use cases from
      tracking baseball bats, to bringing mobile into VR, to attaching the Tracker
      on a camera enabling the user to take photos inside VR. \n\nAs consumer VR
      enters its second year, developers are constantly pushing the limits of understanding
      for VR across in and out of home entertainment, and now they have an entirely
      new way to pair physical objects with the VR environment across all of SteamVR
      and OpenVR. This means more ways for developers to monetize their content,
      build unique VR experiences for third parties, and even bring hardware accessories
      into the VR ecosystem in retail. \n\nVinay Narayan (HTC Vive) highlights how
      the Vive Tracker can be used from a hardware and software perspective to improve
      VR experiences. The Vive Tracker enables developers to motion track objects
      in VR without the need for other expensive products or software.\n\nSpeaker:\nVinay

      In
      this Live Training Session, we will look at creating visual effects for games
      using Particle Systems. The techniques we will learn include using trail effects,
      adding noise to Particle Systems and creating particles which shed light on
      the scene. We will be using content from the Unity Particle Pack which is available
      as a free download from the Unity Asset Store.'

      In
      this live training example we will look at a common need for many games: localizing
      text into other languages. We will create a LocalizationManager class that
      loads a file with localized text, and a component that can be attached to a
      text field in order to populate it with the localized text at runtime.  We
      will also look at loading and parsing JSON files, dictionaries and some data
      driven best practices.'

      building a Networked Multiplayer First Person Shooter game from the ground
      up. The content will range from beginner to intermediate as we look at scripting
      and features specific to multiplayer networking. Even if you''ve watched the
      previous Merry Fragmas episodes, you''ll want to come back for these as we
      are revisiting previous topics and looking at new / alternate methods of implementing
      them. Additionally, we''ll explore more on the concept of a lobby, networked
      animations, gameplay logic, and UI / polish. Let the slay bells ring!'

      Merry Fragmas everyone! Mike Geig
      is back and bringing the holiday fear! In this multi-day session we will be
      building a Networked Multiplayer First Person Shooter game from the ground
      up. The content will range from beginner to intermediate as we look at scripting
      and features specific to multiplayer networking. Even if you''ve watched the
      previous Merry Fragmas episodes, you''ll want to come back for these as we
      are revisiting previous topics and looking at new / alternate methods of implementing
      them. Additionally, we''ll explore more on the concept of a lobby, networked
      animations, gameplay logic, and UI / polish. Let the slay bells ring!'

    description: 'Being able to create 3D models and surfaces on the fly is a powerful
      part of the Unity API that is often overlooked. These techniques are especially
      useful for games and apps using procedural content but it can also be used
      to create more powerful tools for making hand crafted experiences. In this
      talk Alexander Birke (Out Of Bounds Games) describes: 1. The basics of how
      Unity''s mesh API works 2. Practical examples of games where he has used procedural
      meshes to achieve novel gameplay and aesthetics such as a 1 draw call 2D deferred
      lighting system, morphable physics colliders, improved line rendering and polygonal
      procedural levels. 3. Common strategies to assign triangle indices, the most
      tricky part of the process 4. General tips on achieving better performance
      with the mesh API for both dynamic and static meshes'

    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BV4C0sTkz_w
    channelName: Unity
    description: "Eric Gundersen (Mapbox) walks us through how to customize Mapbox's
      mapping and location developer tools for Unity.  \n\nMapbox powers billions
      of maps for the world's most innovative companies and now they're using their
      extensive location tech to build the deepest set of spatial tools for Unity.
      They provide tools for rendering a game world based on map data at run time,
      and also support geocoding, directions, map matching, and datasets. Own and
      host your datasets with Mapbox, generate and query points of interest, and
      style and design your own maps. Each of these services adds important contextual
      aspects to gameplay and enable experimentation with spatial data in games,
      enabling developers to come up with new ways of blending reality with game
      worlds. When you have access to geospatial data of the entire world new types
      of gameplay become possible.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/08pm/"

      game. We will create the core game loop - timer, score, win and lose states.
      We will also show code architecture best practices - keeping data and logic
      separate, and how to structure a game in a way that makes it easy to maintain
      and extend. We will look at some of the ways we can extend this in session

      In
      this live training we will learn the updated workflow for creating and populating
      scroll-lists at run time using the Scroll Rect interaction component. We will
      use this to create a simple two column shop where items can be bought and sold
      between two lists. A Scroll Rect can be used when content that takes up a lot
      of space needs to be displayed in a small area. The Scroll Rect provides functionality
      to scroll over this content.

      scroll-lists at run time using the Scroll Rect interaction component. We will
      use this to create a simple two column shop where items can be bought and sold
      between two lists. A Scroll Rect can be used when content that takes up a lot
      of space needs to be displayed in a small area. The Scroll Rect provides functionality
      to scroll over this content.

      In
      this live training session we will create a flexible player ability system
      which includes player abilities with cool downs, similar to those seen in MOBA
      or MMO games. The approach uses scriptable objects and is designed to allow
      game designers to create multiple variations of an ability and swap between
      them easily.

      In
      this tutorial we will learn how to create a gun for a first person game which
      shoots using a raycast. We will cover raycasting, getting information about
      what we hit, debugging raycasts and drawing a visible laser line using a LineRenderer.

    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxj9Va6EYxI
    channelName: Unity
    description: 'Movement in VR is challenging. When a player''s avatar moves differently
      to the player''s body in real life, the brain receives conflicting signals
      from its senses. Placing players in a virtual cockpit can help significantly,
      abstracting the motion to a vehicle rather than the body. However the brain
      still expects to experience rotational and lateral forces from the motion of
      the vehicle. In developing the VR version of Sublevel Zero, a six-degree-of-freedom
      shooter, you need to work out how to allow players complete freedom of movement,
      without needing to throw up. This talk, given by Gary Lloyd and Luke Thompson
      (Sigtrap Ltd), explain their experiences with vehicle motion in VR, and how
      they have solved the problems that it''s presented. Sublevel Zero''s six axis
      motion allows them to give a generalised perspective on almost any type of
      vehicular movement.

    channelName: Unity
    description: 'With the fast developments of powerful Augmented, Mixed and Virtual
      reality devices like HoloLens science fiction movie technology is becoming
      reality for consumers. In this session, Rene Schulte (IdentityMine) talks about
      the challenges that AR and VR pose and why 3D is an essential part of this
      experience. Comprehensible demos show how every developer can develop outstanding
      HoloLens solutions with Unity and be part of this computing revolution. This
      session helps you to understand how to setup your Unity environment, what skills
      you need to create compelling HoloLens applications and what are the best practices
      to move forward quickly. Starting with a simple "MR Hello World" demo, we use
      this to understand all of the pieces required to run your app. Last, but not
      least, we demonstrate some of the applications that Rene and his team have
      been working on in the past few months, to give the viewers a sense of what
      can be accomplished with the right skill targeting one of the most anticipated
      devices in a while. This session presents the challenges we faced while building
      HoloLens apps and how we solved them. Additionally, best practices and recommendations
      to avoid pit falls are discussed.

    description: 'We all know how Free-To-Play design has elevated the mobile games
      industry to new heights; but beneath the monetisation is a quieter revolution.
      The use of analytics. Using data to understand players allows us to create
      better, more targeted, more responsive games. It also helps give us more insight
      to make sure that we get the most profitable return on the game - so we can
      keep adding and improving to this and future games. In this session, Oscar
      Clark Evangelist at Unity Technologies, shares lessons from his 18 years of
      running profitable games services focused on one key perspective - the Player
      Lifecycle. He shows how Player&#39;s needs change over time and that we need
      to ensure our game responds and adapts to them in order to maximise retention,
      monetisation and even acquisition. He explores the key data points which allow
      us to recognise the most dangerous moments in the lifecycle of a player as
      they move from Discovery to Learning, then Engaging and finally Churning. How
      can we recognise when players enter these stages? and what we can do to help
      maximise their enjoyment of the game? Only by paying attention to the data
      can we give our game the best chance of success. This session helps learning

      marrying turn based combat mechanics married with rich character development

      of pioneering studios
    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFJavp5aAZA
    channelName: Unity
    description: 'Niels Monshouwer (WeirdBeard) and Geertsje Postma (WEB.foundation)
      talk about the uprising culture of gaming in Africa. Considering all the challenges
      and the fast growth of mobile devices and infrastructure on a continent of
      1billion people with great cultures and rich traditions, innovative industries
      are ready to spawn. Leti Arts has pioneered since 2009 the gaming industry
      which has served as a motivation to spawn a lot more in the sub Saharan region.
      From their talk at GDC 2013 titled the Emerging Landscape of African Game development,
      they wish to share how the growth has been since 2013 especially with skillset
      and the various tools being used including UNITY on the continent and how the
      gaming culture had improved and showing promise of monetization. (http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1018024/The-Emerging-Landscape-of-African)
      Below was the description from our GDC 2013 Talk. They give an update on how
      it has improved and share how they as Leti Arts have innovated around their
      challenges. For African audiences, video games are only a new medium to play
      what has already existed for centuries before. A video game developer in Africa
      must be able to design across the cultural boundaries, and educate the player
      in using new interactive technologies. There has been tremendous growth in
      mobile technology and the number of mobile users, so mobile phones have become
      the most popular gaming platform. However, political issues have affected many
      communities on the continent, which has led to any media, such as newspapers,
      television, and radio, being sensitive about the content they release to the
      public. Video games are no exception to this rule, and thus game creators must
      be careful about the themes and ideas behind their games.

      Atoms In The Known Universe
    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMlRF1OW4qM
    channelName: Unity
    description: 'ZeroLight works with car models that can have just about anything
      configured on them. This results in the number of unique car configurations
      possible being numbers so long they are impossible to say never mind test.
      In this presentation Chris O''Connor (Zerolight) describes the methods implemented
      to enable the development teams to cope with such large quantities of data
      and configurations. Selective automation is the key to manageable testing and
      avoiding any human error. This ensures they always deliver the best quality
      results to their clients.

    description: 'Unity''s large and friendly user community is often cited as one
      of its greatest strengths, with the active online forums providing a wealth
      of information, experience, and advice for users. However, if the only time
      you log on is to ask for technical help or to promote your newly-launched game,
      you''re missing out on many potential opportunities that community involvement
      can bring. In this session, Alastair Aitchison (Norfolk Game Developers) describes
      some of the benefits he''s experienced from involvement with online and local
      game development communities - forming teams, receiving job offers, developing
      a featured asset, gaining coverage in national media, and making friends -
      and gives you some tips as to how you too can profit from being an active part
      of a community.

    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJO9qTjR3UI
    channelName: Unity
    description: 'Being able to create 3D models and surfaces on the fly is a powerful
      part of the Unity API that is often overlooked. These techniques are especially
      useful for games and apps using procedural content but it can also be used
      to create more powerful tools for making hand crafted experiences. In this
      talk Alexander Birke (Out Of Bounds Games) describes: 1. The basics of how
      Unity''s mesh API works 2. Practical examples of games where he has used procedural
      meshes to achieve novel gameplay and aesthetics such as a 1 draw call 2D deferred
      lighting system, morphable physics colliders, improved line rendering and polygonal
      procedural levels. 3. Common strategies to assign triangle indices, the most
      tricky part of the process 4. General tips on achieving better performance
      with the mesh API for both dynamic and static meshes'

      (Sandbox Interactive) takes you behind the (technical) scenes. He takes a look
      at the structure of the server farm and its inner workings, the databases,
      the threading and message processing model and many other interesting implementation
      aspects. On the client side, Albion uses the well-known Unity game engine.
      The second part of the talk describes how they use Unity! Audience addressed:
      Programmers interested in online or MMO games. The talk is suitable for beginners,
      but some aspect of it will assume experience with threading and a basic understanding
      of SQL / NoSQL databases. Takeaway: - learn about the architecture of a modern
      MMO game, including aspects like scalability - learn how to use Unity in a
      big game project without making the core game logic depend on Unity

    description: 'Did you know you can create your own editor within the Unity Editor?
      If you know Unity Editor Scripting you can create any tool you want to speed
      up your design process. Everyone knows tasks they have to do over and over
      and over again. Switching build targets, aligning objects or changing back
      and forth between play and edit mode. If you create an editor script for these
      tasks you not only save a lot of time, you also get a massive happiness boost
      every time you use your scripts to get ahead. Oliver Eberlei (Hammer Labs)
      explains the basics.

      Merry
      Fragmas everyone! Mike Geig returns with a festive live training session packed
      with wanton yuletide destruction! In this session we will be building a Networked
      Multiplayer First Person Shooter game. The content will range from beginner
      to intermediate as we look at scripting and features specific to multiplayer
      networking. As this is an updated version of the Merry Fragmas live training
      from last December, some concepts will move more quickly. Another notable change
      is that this year we will be using the new networking system built into Unity
      instead of Photon. Pack a lunch because we are going to complete this in a
      single session even if it means we go over our usual 1 hour limit. Let the
      slay bells ring!

      than innovative technology and gameplay. The gaming experience is equally affected
      by your game''s ability to manage power consumption and avoid device heat ups
      as today''s consumers expect always-on connectivity and all-day battery life
      from their mobile devices. These factors can impact a game''s success by limiting
      game performance and creating an unplayable mobile experience.

    description: 'Allegorithmic develops the new generation of 3D texturing software:
      Substance Painter, Substance Designer and Bitmap2Material. With most AAA game
      studios using these tools (and many indies), Substance has become the industry
      standard for creating next-generation PBR (Physically Based Rendering) assets.
      Indeed, Photoshop is becoming less and less relevant for game developers since
      the rise of PBR, which is native in Unity 5.


      In this session, we will
      talk about PBR (Physically Base Rendering) in Unity 5 and give a live demo
      of workflows to create PBR-ready textures.

    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pdteyRbou8
    channelName: Unity
    description: 'Project Tango is a focused effort to accelerate the progress and
      adoption of 3D tracking and sensing technologies on mobile devices. It is a
      platform for developing advanced new experiences that respond to the player''s
      physical movement in real-time, while simultaneously generating a 3D map of
      the environment. This talk we discuss some of the underlying technologies that
      make this possible, such as the hardware sensors and some of the software algorithms.
      We will also show demonstrations of current state of the technology, the developer
      SDK, partner applications, and discuss the role of 3D sensing in mobile gaming,
      indoor navigation, virtual reality, and augmented reality.

      beyond gaming and entertainment. AR is projected to eclipse virtual reality
      and become a $100 billion industry over the next decade. We are only beginning
      to explore how practical applications of AR in science, medicine, engineering,
      commerce and education can improve lives. Augmented reality connects the digital
      and physical worlds with the human brain. The diverse and deep knowledge developers
      need to build these applications spans sensory perception, computer vision,
      physics, tracking and statistical data analysis, and more. This talk provides
      concrete demonstrations using the Meta platform and lessons learned from Meta
      engineers.

    description: 'Many platforms, like VR and mobile, place high demands on developers
      to meet acceptable framerates or else risk failure. Often, the art assets in
      a Unity project looks fantastic but no matter how optimized the codebase is,
      the build just doesn''t meet the desired frame rate. Unoptimized art assets,
      including some art which may be purchased on the Asset Store, can seriously
      hinder performance on demanding platforms. In this session, we will highlight
      some red flags to lookout for in a variety of art asset types and identify
      key optimizations that can be implemented into your art pipeline to significantly
      increase performance on demanding platforms. Art asset types covered will include:


      *
      3D Models, Animations and Rigs

      * 2D Textures and Sprites

      * Materials
      and Shaders

  - title: Unite 2015 - How To Design Fairer Games IAP
    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCZa0OEnXoM
    channelName: Unity
    description: 'Effective game monetization is about more than just throwing In-App
      Purchase (IAP) items into your game and hoping for the best. Today, too many
      Free2Play developers have left their players feeling uncomfortable about spending
      money through poor game design: so much so that for many gamers, avoiding paying
      has become half of the fun.

      The problem is too many game designers fail
      to appreciate that players don''t buy IAP just because they "like" our games
      - they buy because they expect future value in our games. And in order to maximize
      this sense of value, even our IAP-related design choices must be geared towards
      enhancing our players'' desire to continue playing our game. Lifetime Value
      (LTV) is about focusing on the lifetime of the player, not just how much money
      we can extract from them in the short term.

      This tale will explore what
      influences our players'' decisions to keep playing and spend money in games
      by focusing on their delight using effective game design techniques that deepen
      player engagement.

      Join us to learn how you can approach IAPs more creatively
      and to build more effective monetization while still respecting (and not angering)
      your players.

    channelName: Unity
    description: 'The HTC Vive is the first but certainly not the last piece of VR
      hardware to bring standing, room-scale experiences to the living room or dedicated
      VR room. As designers, the thought of designing an experience that works in
      any configuration or size of living room / office is daunting, with the sheer
      amount of unknowns in the mix. Owlchemy Labs shares their experiences designing
      room-scale VR experiences, learned through the development of Job Simulator,
      an official launch title for SteamVR / HTC Vive. Watch as the team discusses
      tracked input, considerations for real-world ergonomics, skill transference
      in VR, designing for tethered experiences, locomotion, and more.

      as a standard practice for game development. Learn the steps to setup continuous
      integration with Unity, including source control, using Unity Cloud Build,
      using Unity Test Tools for testing, distributing builds to services like HockeyApp
      or Dropbox, writing command-line build scripts with FAKE, and upgrading to
      your own CI server with TeamCity for more advanced scenarios.


      Taking
      a few steps towards full continuous integration will benefit any game and save
      you time: from starting to use source control or just setting up automated
      builds.

      in Homeworld Shipbreakers'
    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNR9Nvjsv9Y
    channelName: Unity
    description: 'Homeworld: Shipbreakers is a real-time strategy game in which hundreds
      of massive vehicles battle it out over the surface of a vast desert planet,
      harvesting resources from crashed spaceships as they struggle for survival
      in a harsh environment. This talk discusses the cinematic tools and procedural
      camera systems used to create beautiful cut-scenes of actors with varying performances.


      Developing
      an NIS, or cut-scene, generally begins with hand-keying cameras. This is great
      when your actors perform exactly the same things each time, but what happens
      if they are AI driven agents, the level changes, or if their behavior is dynamic?
      Blackbird Interactive (BBI) has developed a suite of filmmaker-style tools
      to procedurally control subject framing and camera movement. These systems
      emulate the way a cameraman composes shots and adapts to changes in actor performances
      and the surrounding environment.


      This talk will demonstrate how we
      used procedural cameras to showcase the beauty of Homeworld: Shipbreakers and
      effectively compose our dynamic vehicle behaviours. The mechanics of the cameras
      will be deconstructed and shown live in-editor. It should be of interest to
      anyone involved with gameplay cameras or cinematic presentation. More about

    description: 'Anton Hand (Rust Ltd) on how to structure the work of a small independent
      game development studio: "You''ve got this grand vision, and you''re beginning
      to map out your game, and then it hits you. How on earth are you going to get
      all this done?


      In this talk, we''ll be covering how an informed pre-production
      comprising aesthetic direction, modelling style, asset management, lighting
      approach, and more are the difference between success and careening into a
      brick wall. We''ll talk to making the most of your human resources, unpack
      the difference between having specialists and generalists for line-asset production,
      when and how to use the Unity Asset Store best, and what design/production
      decisions are critical to lock-in up front. Lastly, we''ll briefly cover some
      multi-platform strategies, and the sorts of things to be aware of if eventually
      planning to scale down to mobile, or scale up to VR. Expect a rapid-fire pace,
      a fair bit of ranting, and the bluntness you might expect from a veteran 3d
      modeller who''s tired of seeing great projects go off the rails.


      We
      at RUST LTD. have over the years become experts in the art of the insane small-team
      rush-project. We''ve studied and iterated on our internal production processes,
      and consulted with teams spanning Indie Games, Archviz, VR, Art Installation
      and all steps in between. Completing a limited-resource project (and really,
      aren''t they all?) can be a challenging endeavour, and we''d like to share
      the process that we''ve developed with you."

    description: 'Dots and TwoDots were born from individual creators that have the
      ability to game design, graphic design, and code their visions to life. This
      model works fine when one person is able to bring all these unique skill sets
      to the table, but what happens when you try to build a a team around this model?
      Dot''s Head of Engineering, Chris Deaner will talk about how he believes that
      everyone that works at dots should consider themselves an engineer, an artist,
      and a musician and how Unity helps make that effort a reality.

    channelName: Unity
    description: 'Successfully adding AR or VR to your studio''s arsenal is expensive,
      and requires significant R&D burn. Programmers & Designers must act as "early
      adopters" of this new tech to keep ahead of the curve, and accurately convey
      emerging feature requirements to clients or other developers. The standard
      for developing AR/VR experiences is rapidly evolving as developers pioneer
      new interaction methods & gameplay mechanics. This session will explore best
      practices for AR & VR as we stride in to the future, and how studios can position
      their teams ahead of the development curve.

      work and how they''re written. He starts with some very basic shaders and then
      works his way up to warping entire worlds in the vertex shader and pushing
      some really stunning pixels in the fragment shader. He also briefly touches
      on some of the more advanced shader techniques as a starter for those looking
      to push the envelope.

      2D Roguelike project guides you through creating a turn based, tile based game
      with procedurally generated levels. In the game you play as a lone man trying
      to find food and survive the waste land for as long as you can.


      This
      is part 8 of 14 in which we set up the Player animator controller to control
      the player''s animations.

      This
      2D Roguelike project guides you through creating a turn based, tile based game
      with procedurally generated levels. In the game you play as a lone man trying
      to find food and survive the waste land for as long as you can.


      This
      is part 5 of 14 in which we write our game manager script which uses a singleton
      pattern.

      Merry
      Fragmas everyone! During this live training series, we will be building a multiplayer
      First Person Shooter game. We will be focusing on the animation, physics, networking
      (with Photon), and other tricks that make FPS games what they are. Content
      will range from beginner to intermediate+ (depending on what you consider difficult).
      We will be looking at a lot of scripting and a few pro features (though you
      should still be able to complete the training without pro). I have no idea
      how many days this will span, so I am scheduling it for 3. Please note that
      I do not know how many days will be required to complete this series and what
      is scheduled is just a guess. With that being said, let us crush our foes with
      holiday spirit! -Tutor: Mike Geig

      In
      this lesson we''ll look at controlling our signal flow using Send and Receive
      effects. Send effects allow us to route a duplicate of an audio signal to another
      group or effect in our mixer enabling complex signal flows. We''ll look at
      using sends to route signal to a reverb audio effect.

      AudioMixers
      allow us to control the signal flow of audio sources in a Unity project. Using
      an AudioMixer one can change volume levels, route signals into groups and process
      sounds with audio effects. In this lesson we''ll cover the basics of creating
      and configuring AudioMixers including assigning audio sources to groups, routing
      groups into one another and routing AudioMixers into other audio mixers.

      In
      this lesson we''ll look at Unity''s Duck Volume audio effect.  Duck Volume
      allows us to cause the volume of an audio signal to duck or get quieter based
      on the volume of that signal, or a different one. A common use of this effect
      is sidechain compression. We''ll look at how to set up Duck Volume including
      routing signals to control ducking with Send audio effects.

      Masks
      are used to hide part of a UI Image element. They can be used to define an
      area to animate images into, or in conjunction with the Scroll Rect component
      to achieve a scrollable space.

      Plugins
      allow us to access native code (either managed or unmanaged) within Unity.
      This gives us access to powerful hardware not available on all devices, such
      as trackpads, cameras, an Oculus Rift, etc. In this lesson, we will learn the
      fundamental skills required to write plugins. Note that some of the features
      used in this session require Unity Pro. This session is programming intensive.
      You have been warned. Tutor: Mike Geig

      ever there was a title that says it all, this one is it. In this session, we
      will look at prototyping a game mechanic whereby the player can throw a teleporter
      and be transported to its location. We will look at a couple of ways of achieving
      this effect, and talk about the strengths and weaknesses of each. Also, there
      may be waffles. Tutor: Mike Geig

      You''ve
      probably seen the sample 2D assets, watched the infinite runner presentation,
      and played around with the 2D tools in Unity. That''s all well and good if
      you want to make side scrolling 2D games, but what about top-down 2D games?
      In this session we are going to look at making top-down style 2D games in Unity.
      We will examine the ways to build scenes, ways to control characters, and some
      of the more confusing elements of the top-down style (including things like
      attacking). "Stabbing" is the new "explosions". Tutor: Mike Geig

    description: 'This first part of this session will introduce Mono.Cecil, what
      can be done with it and what can''t, and demonstrate its usage with examples
      tailored for Unity users. Mono.Cecil is a library to analyze and manipulate
      IL code and binaries. Anytime you feel limited by the compiler of your language
      of choice, you can post-process your binaries with Cecil and reshape them into
      what you want.

      The second half of this session will demonstrate advanced
      reflection techniques to go above and beyond the Inspector. What if you want
      to see all the properties of your objects, including those with get/set accessors?
      Or you want to inspect an object that isn''t a GameObject or Component?

    description: 'Watch this video in context on Unity''s learning pages here: http://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/modules/beginner/live-training-archive/object-pooling

      You
      may have made games in the past that created and destroyed a lot of items (such
      as bullets or enemies). What you may not have known is that the act of instantiating
      and destroying are inefficient and can slow your projects down. In this session,
      we will look at a new way of handling this. This way is called object pooling.
      Tune in to learn the concepts of object pulling as well as how to build a generic
      pooler object than can be used in all of your projects.

      Jump
      to 4:07 to bypass intro and technical issues.

      Do you want to know how
      to keep your data between scenes? How about between executions of your game?
      During this session we will learn how to do both. We will look at things like
      DontDestroyOnLoad, PlayerPrefs, and data serialization. Note that this session
      is coding intensive. It is advisable that you understand datatypes and OOP
      concepts before attending. Tutor: Mike Geig

      getting in the way. In this video we will learn about the navmesh obstacle
      component and how to apply it to objects in a scene.

      when the super human hero walks away from an explosion in slow motion. With
      that in mind, I decided to recreate this magical moment in Unity using assets
      from the Asset Store. In this session we will talk about scene composition,
      effects like slow-motion, and using canned assets to build rich media. Let''s
      be honest though, mostly this session is about having fun. Come join us while

      This
      session will serve as an hour long overview of scripting in Unity. We will
      go at a slow pace and answer any questions you might have about the fundamentals
      of programming. This is a continuation of the previous scripting primer. As
      such, we will pick up where we left off. Topics we will be reviewing are variables,
      conditionals, loops, and functions. Note that this is a beginner training,
      so we will get through as much material as possible, but the focus will be
      on answering any questions you might have. For best results, view the materials
      on scripting here: http://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/modules/beginner/scripting
      and the previous live session here: http://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/modules/beginner/live-training-archive/scripting-primer
      before attending. This will help you have some basic understanding and questions
      prepared for when we are live.

    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dP7R-GbFkM
    channelName: Unity
    description: 'Let''s Make a Game (LMG). With the Global Game Jam fast approaching,
      we figured it would be a cool idea to walk through the creation of a game.
      With that in mind, we present the infinite runner in one hour challenge. During
      this session, we will prototype and build the foundations of an infinite runner.
      We will try to cover as much as possible in the time we have. This game will
      be a platformer / runner using Unity''s 2D tools. Come check it out! Tutor:
      Mike Geig

      go at a slow pace and answer any questions you might have about the fundamentals
      of programming. This is a continuation of the previous scripting primer. As
      such, we will pick up where we left off. Topics we will be reviewing are variables,

      so we will get through as much material as possible, but the focus will be
      on answering any questions you might have. For best results, view the materials

      from our scripts. Doing so give us the ability to write scripts specifically
      to improve our workflow. In this video you will learn how to create buttons
      in a custom inspector and how to tie them to functions that exist in our scripts.

      existing items. In this video you will learn how to use the DrawDefaultInspector
      function.
